Episode,Date,Review
35,"Dec 30, 2020","Just look at that bright smile that says ""who is the tenant now, motherfuckers"". Dokja, you cool bastard."
35,"Dec 30, 2020",Dokja came through and evicted this man from his own property nice.
35,"Dec 30, 2020","Now I am interested, is Dokja going to tell LHS anything about himself, or will he keep on dodging the question?  I bet that soon there is going to be a point where dokja just cant avoid the question anymore, and I am interested in what will happen then.  
Edit: Spoilers in the replies, tread at your own risk!"
35,"Dec 30, 2020",The constellation “Satisfied Reader” smiles upon you. You have been gifted 5 coins.
35,"Dec 30, 2020",What a reversal of roles... dokja what’s your back story bro we NEED TO KNOW😁 pleaseeee🥺
35,"Dec 30, 2020",I really wanna know what he’s saving for that costs THAT many coins. Makes me wonder if this world is that much more about items than it is about stats. Or maybe he stats only accordingly to what he thinks he needs for that area and the rest of the coins are surplus.
35,"Dec 30, 2020","As someone who's had his fair share of bad landlords, this was more satisfying than it had any right to be."
35,"Dec 30, 2020",getting to know the characters better from your favorite novel is any readers dream
35,"Dec 30, 2020","i wonder if he’ll ever feel like he’s really part of the story and group like everyone else, or will he always feel like an observer looking in "
35,"Dec 31, 2020",I can not explain the coincidence I encountered of   Hyeonseang attribute blossoming and my spotify playing the kung-fu panda theme song...it was fantastic
35,"Dec 30, 2020",He’s scary when he smiles😂🤣😂😂
35,"Dec 30, 2020","he protect, he attack, but most importantly he give the ground a big ol smack "
35,"Jan 16, 2021",Dokja became a communist 
35,"Dec 30, 2020","[the constellation ""Lazy Broke Weeb"" sayas not to disrespect women in front of the incarnation LHS and is currently absorbed by its blossoming.] [5 coins have been sponsored.]"
35,"Jan 20, 2021","The first one to fall for Dokja is the himbo, and I wouldn't have it any other way."
35,"Dec 30, 2020",Awesome. Cool fantasy becoming friends with one of your favorite characters.
35,"Dec 30, 2020","Hyeonseong uses hulk smash, it was super effective"
35,"Dec 30, 2020","Dokja's smile make me think next chapter will have a lot of interesting torment for Dokja's enemies. I give 5 coins almost every Wednesday due to my love of this webtoon, and kinda addicted. Lol anyone else like that???"
35,"Jan 27, 2021","I love that Dokja really is a Schemer from skin to the bone. With the knowledge how to push the people to blossom their abilities, he's a real leader. Until now my most beloved Mc ever. *-*"
35,"Feb 17, 2021",I really love the scene where Hyunsung throw his shield to Dokja. So he can defend himself using Hyunsung's shield. The art in that scene is soo good.
35,"Dec 30, 2020",He’s looking at him smiling like an adult smiling at a nieve child .... priceless 
35,"Feb 17, 2021","I love how orv explores breaking the boundaries of a story. We get to see relationships develop between kdj as a reader and the characters of the novel, so it goes from one sided to two sided. Also, the experience of orv novel readers getting to see their favorite scenes drawn out in a visual adaptation compared to kdj being excited seeing his favorite novel scenes play out in real life is interesting to think about."
35,"Feb 17, 2021",dayummm dokja really said I'm a ✨✨communist✨✨😳😩
35,"Dec 30, 2020",Just to let y’all know... there are over 500 chapters in omniscient reader. I don’t even think it’s passed chapter 40 on here yet so be prepared for much more plot! 
35,"Dec 30, 2020","that's the smile of a man ready to fistfight the gods and win. haha, get rekt y'all."
35,"Jan 1, 2021",Not me shipping Dokja and Hyeonseon. Also HAPPY NEW YEARS!!!! and do you realize that the name of next year is 2020 won
35,"Feb 17, 2021",Dokja suddenly sounds communist. 
35,"Dec 30, 2020",YES! DEMOLISH LAND OWNERSHIP! THE LAND BELONGS TO ALL! ANIMISM RULes...... did I get too excited there? 😅
35,"Dec 30, 2020",Dokja is right. It's so beautiful. Wish you could get an anime series.
35,"Dec 30, 2020",Dokja’s smile at the end literally makes this whole chapter 😁- hes like if you only knew my power bro... now Kneel before me... wink
35,"Feb 17, 2021","Hyeonseong be like, ""I wanna get to know you more, Dokja,"" but no homo... unless 👀"
35,"Feb 17, 2021","Can we just give Hyeonseong a great appreciation for being strong but at the same time innocent? Like, he's so freaking cute when he's kinda shy and insecure but look at him getting so strong! Really looking forward for the development of their friendship :""("
35,"Feb 17, 2021","So I just look the pattern. When Dokja meet Jonghyuk, readers : SHIP! When Heewon blossom, readers : SHIP! now when Hyunsung blossom, also readers : SHIP! YES DOKJA IS SHIPABLE WITH ANYONE, EVEN WITH BIHYUNG 😂😂"
35,"Feb 17, 2021",I think this is the first time  Dokja is admitting how bizarre it is that he is walking along his favourite characters
35,"Feb 17, 2021","I love the fact that every female character in ORV is fleshed out and has their own aspirations and flaws. sometimes in action stories, they tend to forget about the side characters and focus on the MC, but ORV does a really good job crafting unique personalities for the women, I love it"
35,"Feb 18, 2021","I’m not a parent but I feel like my son just got accepted into college, go hyeonseong"
35,"Dec 30, 2020",Dokja just destroyed capitalism 
35,"Feb 17, 2021","Many people here think Dokja is sorta manipulative or that he is a morally grey character while I can't think of a more perfect example of a morally good character that isn't cheesy. I find his actions pretty natural and good intended for now. Here some people don't see he encouraging his group to encourage Hyseong to be totally ethic, is not like he is doing to put them in danger, he is trying to get the best of them so everyone in the group benefits from it."
35,"Feb 8, 2021",I want them to get closer. This little found family is so precious. ❤
35,"Jan 20, 2021",BROMANCE!!!!!!
35,"Feb 17, 2021",Hope y’all didn’t forget to say Happy Birthday to Kim Dokja. It was his birthday at Feb. 15 🥳 Happy Birthday Kim Dokja!!!
35,"Feb 17, 2021",This episode was... groundbreaking! ....I'll see myself out.
35,"Feb 17, 2021",I honestly love how how in the middle of a battle dojka is low key fangirling about how one of the characters wants to know about him
35,"Feb 18, 2021","Damn Dokja, you smooth mf"
35,"Feb 19, 2021",Anyone else gathering materials to build a ship?
35,"Feb 17, 2021","Fun reminder that it was our beloved reader, Dokja's birthday on the 15th."
35,"Feb 17, 2021",Dokja is literally living the dream. Imagine your fav character being interested in YOU like BRUH
35,"Jan 27, 2021",So LHS is Captain America and Hulk combined. Interesting 
35,"Dec 31, 2020",I love it when oversized cinnamon roll characters become OP and defeat all of the annoying bad guys
35,"Dec 31, 2020","Mao Zedong leading the Communist Revolution in China, 1949 (colorized)."
35,"Feb 17, 2021",When Hyeonseong threw the shield at Dokja... that was an avengers move right there 
35,"Feb 17, 2021","my friend said that you can search this manhwa on an illegal manga site, but naaah, I'll read this legally to support the creator"
35,"Feb 19, 2021",the constellation 'simping and shipping' giggles once more as the landlord bitch got what he deserved.
35,"Feb 18, 2021",pure bromance
35,"Feb 18, 2021",Dokja realizing that he’s actually an important person to others around him and that others care for him and are interested in getting to know him warms my heart. His entire life he’s felt worthless and a waste of space but seeing the formidable characters in TWSA that he’s always admired care for him and call him their friend is touching his heart in way that’s never been touched before. I love it so much
35,"Dec 30, 2020",It's so refreshing to see bad landlords fall (in this case quite literally) haha
35,"Feb 19, 2021","The constellation, Webtoon Fangirl, is happy for Hyeonseong Lee."
35,"Feb 18, 2021",i see peeps arguing whether dokja is being manipulative and is solely looking after his own self. here's my take. he is manipulative but he isn't bad. i think his core is he's still a good guy. if i were him and i am a selfish ahole. i wouldn't save anyone not worth using. i'd be like 'oops i'm weak rn.' & let my teammate die. but he's going thru so much length to keep them all alive. he could've chosen the easy way out of this where he ONLY survives. but he's still being heroic and dependable
35,"Feb 17, 2021",he ready to commit war crimes with that smile
35,"Feb 19, 2021",the ship floats pretty good
35,"Feb 18, 2021",I know I’m not supposed to ship it but I can’t help it
35,"Feb 19, 2021",Dokja is the most intensly chill person I've ever read abt
35,"Feb 17, 2021",Reminder that Dokja's birthday was on the 15th (and Lee Jihye's was on the 14th)
35,"Feb 17, 2021",I gotta introduce Dokja to MY landlord🙄
35,"Dec 30, 2020",Hyeonseong is ✨moist✨ for Dokja... I mean aren’t we all tho
35,"Feb 21, 2021",And that’s how Dokja established communism through the apocalypse
35,"Feb 18, 2021",this should be an anime. its so frikin cool
35,"Feb 17, 2021",i expected the top comments to be about communism (memes)
35,"Dec 30, 2020","Aw, he's so flattered that one of his favorite characters wants to know about him"
35,"Feb 22, 2021",A BLOSSOMING BROMANCE
35,"Feb 20, 2021","Dokja said ""our property"""
35,"Feb 18, 2021",I love how Hyeonseong is protraied as an angel (it looks like angle wings). It shows how angel like Hyeonseong is. Fav caharacter
35,"Feb 17, 2021",Someone has to say it already: Hyeonseong is hot
35,"Jan 27, 2021",Dokja has the chance that many of us could just dream it (see your favorite scene and talk with one of your favorite fictional characters). I envy you man! 
35,"Feb 18, 2021","I feel like dokja will encounter a conflict within himself because he continuisly sees others as fictional characters, because of TWSA. Dude...you are not in the novel...this is happening to REAL people an one of these days your secret wont continue to be a secret. And by then...maybe your own comrades might turn on you because they will feel as if you just used them...because, Well...you DID."
35,"Feb 18, 2021",THE CONSTELLATION KARL MARX APPROVED YOUR DECISIONS.
35,"Feb 17, 2021","What I love about this chapter is that, we know dokja has foresight into how things work and the events and people, but his reaction to Hyeonseong, hearing him express how this was his favorite scene, how much he loved hyeonseong as a character, and now that character is actually talking to him? Wants to get to know HIM? He’s in the story he loves, but now he’s finally connecting with the things he loved about the story. It’s so heartwarming 🥰"
35,"Feb 23, 2021","Dokja, seeing private property: it's free real estate"
35,"Feb 19, 2021","I was looking forward to this because when I read the web novel I couldn't picture this scene, it's so great to visualized it now "
35,"Feb 17, 2021",I really can't see how this could be any better! It looks fantastic and the story is so awesome I'm fully immersed in every second of it. Plus on top of that the Creator isn't ending every single episode with a gut wrenching cliffhanger making us want to tear out our hair like most other creators are doing. Our most Sincere Thanks for You Creator!!! Thank you so much I could just cry with relief and happiness! YOU ARE THE BEST!!!
35,"Feb 17, 2021",Dokja: *putting 3D glasses on* You're doing great sweetie!
35,"Feb 17, 2021",Without the green zones the landlords are now just another group having to fight to survive! Kin dokja pulled the Best reversal ever: by getting rid of the safe zones he FORCED them to join his side against the monsters
35,"Dec 30, 2020",How those hands looked like wings are one of the most magnificent things i have ever seen. Thank you.
35,"Dec 30, 2020","I'm gonna go broke from webtoon, but hey I'm not complaining."
35,"Dec 30, 2020",I know who won the Best smile superlative in high school😁
35,"May 1, 2021",yessss dokja the anti-capitalist king
35,"Feb 22, 2021",Look at Dokja fanboying over Hyeonseong 😂 nice
35,"Feb 18, 2021",Lets take a trip back in time when coins weren't a thing. 
35,"Dec 30, 2020",No wonder everyone cherished dokja
35,"Dec 30, 2020",DOKJA IS SO COOL PLEASE
35,"May 13, 2021",What could be more satisfying than being the favourite of your favourite character!?❤️💙
35,"Feb 18, 2021",This is the most epic webtoon I've ever encountered so far.. Highly recommend this.. Can't wait for the next episode. You just don't know what will happen next uwu
35,"Feb 18, 2021",Hyeonseong really is now Captain America 2.0
35,"Feb 18, 2021",can we take a note on how long this is and we are only on scenario 3 out of like 90+
35,"Feb 17, 2021",my love for Dokja 📈📈📈📈📈
35,"Feb 26, 2021","Dokja really said""Hippity Hoppity, GET OFF THE PROPeRTY."""

35,"Feb 17, 2021",KIM DOKJA COMMUNIST KING
35,"Feb 17, 2021","Oh you webtoon readers have a LOOOOOOONG road ahead of you. As someone who's close to chapter 400, this novel by far stomps over any other story I have ever read."
35,"Feb 17, 2021","if pildo is a landlord collecting rent, dokja is the government  collecting  taxes"

35,"Feb 17, 2021",Yall this webtoon is so good it’s making me imagine what would it be like if I were stuck in the same apocalypse and oh god I don’t think I’ll survive
35,"Feb 17, 2021",Dokja said no one individual owns property and the constellation Karl Marx smiles upon him and gifts 0 coins
35,"Feb 17, 2021","Even though its not romance-based, there are so many potential ships."
35,"Feb 17, 2021","Dokja and his innocent smile, so innocent yet so so dangerous "
35,"Jan 4, 2021","no one may ever see this comment, but i gotta say...i'm soooo glad this week's fast pass didnt run out on a cliff hanger!"

35,"Feb 17, 2021","I really really like this. I think the fact that Dokja is living in the world of his favorite novel, seeing his favorite characters as a reader this is something that makes me feel jealous  (?) a little....idk I feel like I might cry."
35,"May 2, 2021",What's blossoming is a bromance... but without the B 
35,"Apr 28, 2021",Dokja rlly said communism✨
35,"Apr 26, 2021",Dokja’s Communism attribute is blossoming 
35,"Apr 1, 2021",just kiss already

35,"Feb 19, 2021","the art is,amazing😦"
35,"Feb 19, 2021"," ""back to a time where none of us owned a private property"" damn, dokja really called the greedy landlords out"
35,"Feb 19, 2021",communism intensifies*
35,"Feb 19, 2021",So you're telling me Hyeonseong Lee is actually Monkey D. Luffy and ate the gum-gum fruit. His enlarged arm looks like a gum-gum ability.
35,"Feb 19, 2021",based private property abolitionist dokja
35,"Feb 18, 2021","Dokja could have said ""I'm just good at reading people"" and it would be literal"

35,"Feb 18, 2021",hipity hopity no more property
35,"Feb 18, 2021","The ""You're f*cked"" smile is here!!"
35,"Feb 18, 2021",I believe his power would be even greater because he blossomed of his own free will. Yes Dokja is manipulating them all but they think they’re moving according to free will. All these twist and turns are cool. 
35,"Feb 18, 2021",my man's killed everyone my man's  overpowered 
35,"Feb 18, 2021",I’m here for the blossoming attributes and the blossoming friendships 🤧
35,"Feb 18, 2021",Dokja giving the sweetest smile while saying some intimidating shit is something Dokja would totally do lol
35,"Feb 18, 2021",I know the author got inspired from One Punch Man
35,"Feb 17, 2021","I think there’s a real danger in Dokja viewing this as a book. It’s real life with real people, and even if he read about them prior to this all happening, they are not just characters. That might be his downfall."
35,"Feb 17, 2021","so you see, that's where the trouble began. that smile. that damned unlucky smile. a smile that can make both his friends and enemies to be anxious for completely different reasons (yes i'm reciting that meme)"
35,"Feb 17, 2021","""A supporting character from a novel I read is interested to know about me"" Dokja is living the dream!"
35,"Feb 17, 2021",Can we just talk about that super cute blush that our boy Hyenseong had when talking to Dokja? ❤️❤️
35,"Feb 17, 2021",I think I have a crush on dokja....(๑♡⌓♡๑) BUT CAN YOU BLAME ME LOOK AT HIM HE IS SO COOL
35,"Jul 2, 2021",Everyone keep talking about Dokja but no one talk about how cool Hyeonseong in this chapter. 
35,"Jun 2, 2021",Aww! Does Hyeonseong Lee have a crush?! His blushing is adorable.
35,"May 17, 2021",🤬U just had to ruin the lovely moment didn’t u old man!!!! I reeeeaaaallyy wanted to hear wat cute thing he was about to say 🥰
35,"May 4, 2021",And the most scariest emoji is →→🙂
35,"May 2, 2021",Damn Dojka really made Hyeonseon blush huh 
35,"May 2, 2021",Dokja be really living that Y/N life we all been dreaming of... befriending characters from our fave ficitonal stories. though the situation isn't the best 🤣
35,"Apr 30, 2021",Dokja is essentially just in his own self-insert fanfiction 
35,"Apr 29, 2021",Mc saying he’s impressed by the fact that he is witnessign one of his favourite parts of the novel when we all know that hes actually fangirling like hell
35,"Apr 26, 2021",hyeongseong lee is...so cute... i trust him with my life
35,"Feb 20, 2021",Gum Gum Pistol anyone
35,"Feb 20, 2021",That mask like smile of Dokja's is creeping me out. and LHS development was so bad***. I love this series!
35,"Feb 19, 2021",Did anyone else hear the USSR national anthem?
35,"Feb 19, 2021","if he was me, id long died bcs i probably forgot half of the novel sobs"
35,"Feb 19, 2021",This was such an epic ep. this needs Tower of God treatment and become an animated series. 
35,"Feb 18, 2021",“...when none of us owned any private property” *soviet national anthem plays*
35,"Feb 18, 2021",If i had the money i would by all the coins id need just to keep reading this over and over. would love this to be an anime so i could buy it and watch it over and over.
35,"Feb 18, 2021",Soviet anthem intensifies 
35,"Feb 18, 2021",I love their faces in the second to last panel where Pildu is like 'Damn you' and Kim Dokja's just looking down at him like 'hmm? I wonder what's down here?'
35,"Feb 18, 2021",one punch man?
35,"Feb 18, 2021",AM I THE ONLY ONE READING THIS WEBTOON REALLY CAREFULLY AND OBSERVING THE DETAILS CUZ IM SCARED THAT THIS MIGHT ACTUALLY HAPPEN AFTER THIS WEBTOON ENDS??? 😭😭😭
35,"Feb 18, 2021",PLEASE tell me SOMEONE has made a One Punch Man joke?!
35,"Feb 18, 2021",Was Dokja fangirling for a bit 💀
35,"Feb 17, 2021",is it just me or do y'all felt chills all over my body 🥶✊
35,"Feb 17, 2021",believe me this dokja guy is my favourite main lead from all the webtoon I have ever read
35,"Feb 17, 2021","""Kim Dokja, background unknown. I'd never seen anyone as cunning as him before that day, and never saw anyone as cunning as him ever again."""
35,"Feb 17, 2021",I hate protagonists because they seem boring and the same but DOKJA! HE JUST EVICTED THE LAND OWNER!
35,"Feb 17, 2021",The person who keeps spoiling under some top comments is probably the same person who spoiled on the actual novel comments as well :/ they keep bringing up chapter 400 too and honestly it ruined the reading experience I had because I was only on like chapter 90? Im still reading it but I feel sad that I know parts of the storyline I shouldn’t. Honestly it’s the worse and I just wish they’d stop spoiling either here or on the actual novel 😖😭
35,"Feb 17, 2021",Dokja at the end of this chapter: OUR property
35,"Feb 17, 2021",*don't do it. don't do i- *ONE PUUUUUUUUNNNNCHHHHHHHHH
35,"Feb 17, 2021",AW i really like dokja and hyeonseong’s dynamic
35,"Feb 17, 2021",That smile ♥️
35,"Feb 17, 2021",Dokja just keeps on interacting with characters more like people
35,"Feb 17, 2021",This whole webtoon gotta be the largest fricken test of morals I've ever seen
35,"Jan 4, 2021",I ship it.
35,"Apr 27, 2021",we stan anticapitalist revolutionary dokja
35,"Jul 18, 2021",the fact that dokja has been a big help to huiwon and hyeongseong activating their attributes and that hyeongseong’s activated right when he told him to..that’s crazy i got chills
35,"Jun 4, 2021",dokja is living the y/n life
35,"May 25, 2021",Dokja: I'm overwhelmed. Also Dokja: 😐
35,"May 7, 2021",dokja is a communist confirmed
35,"May 4, 2021",I love it when dokja smiles creepy/shamelessly/sarcastically/ proudly 
35,"May 2, 2021",I don't know how Dokja haven't fainted even once from meeting the characters of his favorite novel. I wouldn't even be able to talk properly.
35,"May 1, 2021",i love lee hyeonseong so much !! he’s so nice and seeing him getting so strong made me rly happy
35,"May 1, 2021",rip karl max.... you would've liked dokja
35,"Apr 30, 2021",They straight up flirting 
35,"Mar 9, 2021",hyeonseong and dokja looks like a cute couple and if jeonghyuk and dokja are looks like a hot couple. 😩🤚✨✨

He won’t save people he doesn’t have to, and if he has to it’s mainly to gain respect of others and constellations. He’s smart and awesome 😏"

I think maybe Hyoensoeng (excuse my terrible spelling please im a simple english speaker) has a wittle crush on a certain Dokja. I mean the blushes, their little interaction in this chapter, just the way he acts around him. And then if he ended up swinging that way, it could open the possibility that he was treated poorly in the army because of it"

35,"Dec 30, 2020","It's always nice to see how Dokja never tires of the characters he's read about for years. Even during this sudden Apocalypse, the first probably honest desire he has revealed about himself is his want to know more of Hyunsung's story that he doesn't know about. Such dedication. "

35,"Dec 30, 2020",First :P
35,"Jan 23, 2021","Yk? I would love it if the artist would change Dokja's appearance or something like that so when can finally have an ""special"" way to recognize him besides his personality. Maybe a scar and yellow or pink hair with one eye different from the other, idk. It's just that I think it would be helpful since Dokja is almost equal as Sung Jin-Woo ( the protagonist of solo-leveling) in terms of appearance... Just my opinion"
