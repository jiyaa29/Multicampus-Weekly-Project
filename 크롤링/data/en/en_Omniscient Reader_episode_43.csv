Episode,Date,Review
43,"Feb 24, 2021",dokja just kinda exposed his self they all gonna be suspicious of him now
43,"Feb 24, 2021",Oh I really hope this tag team turns up to be the baddest duo since Khun and Bam
43,"Feb 24, 2021","I think there is Big Misstranslating here in Jonghyuk stigma it was ""Transmission lv 1"" not ""Reincarnation"" ... Yjh doesn't have reincarnation stigma (srry for my bad english)
note : They fix it! Thankyou translator-nim 🙏"
43,"Feb 24, 2021",Thanks for spoiling the entire plot Dokja. Appreciate it.
43,"Feb 24, 2021","THEY DID IT! They dropped the main image where they're sword v sword and he asks Dokja ""Who the heck are you?!""""AGHH IT'S ABOUT TO GET REALLL"
43,"Feb 24, 2021",[Achievement unlocked: Prolouge complete] 
43,"Feb 24, 2021",So...how many walls did he break?
43,"Feb 24, 2021",Dokja sounds like the best fan boy.
43,"Feb 24, 2021","The Joonghyuk angst & Dokja angst begins 🥺 This moment was so intense when I 1st read this in the novel so I wasn't expecting KDJ's face to look like that when he turned to look at YJH in disbelief after he heard him think he was alone 😂. Anyways, I am not ready for the upcoming rollercoaster of emotions this story puts you thru in the future. (The translation was a bit iffy in this episode. I don't remember ""aliens"" & YJH shouldn't have the reincarnation stigma) EDIT: Spoilers in the replies"
43,"Feb 24, 2021","junghyeok: WHO ARE YOUdokja :  lol i’m just all knowing, sunfish"
43,"Feb 24, 2021",Did we do it? DID WE REACH THE PROLOGUE!?!?
43,"Feb 24, 2021",I am... a READER
43,"Feb 24, 2021","as novel reader to see part how much TWSA and jonghyuk as the protagonist mean to dokja. when he awlays get bullied, when he didn't have any luck in his life. dokja read and watch jonghyuk struggle, to see how jonghyuk didn't give up to survive, give dokja power to keep survive in his lowlest life before. and it make me broke, my chest hurt and almost move on tears. it's tell us that even trivial things is so precious and have a lot of meaning to certain someone"
43,"Feb 24, 2021",Am I the only one who thinks this is one of the most powerful episodes yet? The art and story is just...amazing 👏
43,"Feb 24, 2021",Dokja used spoilers. It was super effective
43,"Feb 24, 2021","[The constellation ""Lazy Broke Weeb"" complains about the censorship and wanted a refund from star stream.] [The constellation ""Lazy Broke Weeb"" has been waiting for the episode to load.] [5 coins have been sponsored.]"
43,"Feb 24, 2021","Dokja sounds like me when I facebook stalk Someone and their whole family. “I’ve never spoke to you, but I know all your struggles and I support you!”"
43,"Feb 24, 2021",Can Junghyeok Yu activate his Cooking lvl 10 skill plz? 🍲👨🏻‍🍳 
43,"Apr 14, 2021","WAIT JUNGHYUK HAD A CHILD?! A FUCKING CHILD?! NO WONDER HE'S FUCKED UP IN THE HEAD WHO COULD HANDLE THE PAIN OF LOSING A CHILD, SISTER, AND LOVED ONE AND THEN REPEAT IT???"
43,"Feb 24, 2021","and so it comes full circle? pretty sure this was the beginning of the first episode Edit: The end of this was exactly in the beginning. Now, let the show BEGIN 😂😂"
43,"Feb 24, 2021","God, Omniscient Reader is *chefs kiss* exquisite!"
43,"Mar 16, 2021","In webnovel Dokja says ""Alone? What did i come here for if you're alone?"" and it's one of my favorite Kim Dokja and Yoo Jonghyuk moments. I'm disappointed they didn't add that conversation i was looking forward to read it :("
43,"Mar 5, 2021",Pleaseeee change the word Aliens to Outer Gods!!! 
43,"Feb 24, 2021","Oh boy, let's see what Dokja comes up with this time. He knows you're not an oracle bro, and that's beyond what an oracle could know anyway. ""yeah Junghyuk I'm actually a regressing stalker"" or something"
43,"Mar 10, 2021","Lmao, the aliens are supposed to be outer gods, and the blue star weapon aura is actually supposed to be breaking the sky Swordmanship "
43,"Feb 24, 2021",Those poor sunfish.
43,"Feb 24, 2021",First novel then webtoon next please make this in to an anime anyway I love how they haven’t missed anything from the novel except for those translation error which I hope will be fixed soon 
43,"Apr 14, 2021"," AGH DOKJA'S GAY SPEECH IS FINALLY HERE I LOVE IT!! But on a serious note, Dokja's reaction to seeing Joonghyuk's regression depression honestly hurts because you realize how emotional this is for him. Joonghyuk surviving through the apocalypse is what kept Dokja surviving for all these years so the fact that he sees the character he has read abt for 10+ years questioning if he even wants to continue to live- pain"
43,"Feb 24, 2021",WE MADE IT TO THE PART FROM THE INTO!!!!!! WOOOOOOOHOOOOOOOOOOO
43,"Feb 24, 2021","I feel like it might cause some confusion in the future calling Junghyuk’s stigma “Reincarnation” since [SPOILER] actual reincarnators appear later in the story 
Edit: Oh hey, they revised it! Thank you translator person, keep on rocking on!"
43,"Apr 14, 2021",Dokja really captured what it means to go on a journey with your books. Its more than just reading. you feel like you're part of the story right alongside the characters. nicely written
43,"Apr 14, 2021",Okay but... his highest skill is cooking. If that ain’t husband material idk what is.
43,"Apr 14, 2021",The FEELS. Dokja being fed up with junghyuk’s depression is relatable 😂. Dokja saying “ i too kept reading so that i could survive “ damn dokja i want to cry 😭 this captured the relation between a reader and the characters real well ☹️ 
43,"Mar 16, 2021","i am once again rereading this chapter.......i just can't get over the 'conversation' they had..... PAIN!!! THEYVE BEEN THROUGH SO MUCH PAIN AND SUFFERING AND AGONY, !!!! kim dokja found solace in reading wos even though the world turned its back on him and yoo joonghyuk is stuck on a neverending cycle of torture, each death, each turn was a reminder of his failures. ..., ....… i hate it here. all of them needs a hug"
43,"Apr 14, 2021","so, is nobody going to comment about his level 10 cooking?"
43,"Apr 14, 2021","oh I forgot to mention this when I commented earlier on why Dokja's speech was so emotional but the suffering Joonghyuk had to go through also makes this chapter very emotional. Regression is a very painful process for him, seeing everyone he cares for die over and over again, and even though it's currently the 3rd turn (which is painful enough) imagine how many regressions he went through in a story with 3,149 chapters. And he's doing it all by himself. Although now he won't be alone :)"
43,"Feb 24, 2021",The Omniscient Reader!!!!!
43,"Apr 14, 2021","give up dokja, you'll never win against lvl 10 cooking 😔"
43,"Apr 7, 2021",Oml he had a child with a person?? I wanna meet the girl who could steal that ruthless man’s heart!!
43,"Feb 24, 2021",I’ve been waiting for that final panel since Chapter 1. FINALLY!
43,"Apr 14, 2021",when you hate spoilers but the MC himself spoil the story 👁👄👁
43,"Mar 3, 2021","i am pretty sure it's supposed to be ""OUTER GODS"" not aliens... pls return it to outer gods. It's also better than just aliens."
43,"Apr 14, 2021","Novel spoilers*********
The fact that at different points in time they were each others reason to stay alive always gets me "
43,"Apr 14, 2021","I like seeing this vulnerable side of JH. He’s not cold because he wants to be, the man is traumatized and hurt from all the regressions and death of his peers he’s been through. I love how Dokja is lowkey his ride or die even tho they clash. Reading Jh’s struggle helped him get through his own. They’re like best friends but don’t know it yet"
43,"Apr 14, 2021","junghyeok: ""i'm all alone"" | dokja: *offended noises*"
43,"Apr 14, 2021","I'm not liking this ""official translation"" at all. Where's Breaking the Sky Swordsmanship...Returnees etc...  I feel the translation of this chapter lost some of the weight of this scene tbh."
43,"Mar 3, 2021",There is a translation error. Aliens are supposed to be outer gods. I hope they fix it.
43,"Apr 14, 2021","we were just so busy being amazed by his vast knowledge and memory that we forgot dokja himself is a human who has gone through a lot worse making him find solace in a webtoon novel like many of us, an escape from reality, idk why but this fact hits hard above all"
43,"Apr 14, 2021","welp you just either made a new ship, screwed yourself or gave the cinema master a new interesting play toy"
43,"Mar 23, 2021","I'm not hating here, but why the translation is so bad? so many mistakes, will it hurt to look through the novel for some parts? Well, the reaction of most of the ppl about this chapter is a little disappointing  almost no one commenting about Yu's past and his pain, or about Dokja's pain."
43,"Apr 14, 2021","KIM DOKJAAAA😭😭😭 didn't realize this until further on in the novel, but this part right here just cuts. So. Deep. For a reader to have been that invested in a character, in Yoo Jonghyuk. I can't say this enough, but seeing the art makes me feel so happy that I can now put a face to the characters' intense interaction. Yoo Jonghyuk, you dumb sunfish 😭😭😭😭 "
43,"Feb 24, 2021",oh shit he exposed himself 
43,"Apr 14, 2021",lmfao cant wait for the gay baby joke
43,"Apr 14, 2021","""why is it that my eyes are tearing up?"" THEN DRAW HIM CRYING YOU COWARDS"
43,"Apr 14, 2021",Everyone say thank you to Gilyeong for the sunfish information 
43,"Apr 14, 2021","""Cooking Lv. 10"" damn he be a master chef. can't win against that"
43,"Feb 28, 2021","junghyeok: ""WHO ARE YOU? HOW DO YOU KNOW EVERYTHING ABOUT ME??"" dokja: ""BECAUSE---Because I'm your stan..."" *dramatic music plays*"
43,"Feb 24, 2021",Every page of this comic is GOLD 👏🏻
43,"Apr 16, 2021",who took an hour reading one chapter because one's still admiring the art?  just me?  okay
43,"Apr 14, 2021",joonghyuk really said “yes i do the cooking yes i do the cleaning” with that cooking stat 😩
43,"Feb 25, 2021",now we are upto 7% of the original novel
43,"Apr 14, 2021",Dokja Kim: The biggest spoiler of all time 
43,"Apr 7, 2021","I bought this chapter accidentally, I did not remember that I had coins, but I do not regret anything "
43,"Feb 24, 2021","I keep watch webtoon have mistranslation or mistake in the translation, even in the previous chapter there's also mistranslation especially in skill, atribute and stigma. I just hope maybe webtoon can check the novel translation to get better translation. and please add the honorific"
43,"Apr 15, 2021",when you a badass but your mentality unstable
43,"Apr 15, 2021","I dont understand why this webtoon is losing readers after each chapter;, like??? it just keeps on getting better what is wrong with u people"
43,"Apr 14, 2021","Guys i know a lot of us read the light novel, but lets just enjoy the art and relive our memories and stop giving spoilers ok? The webtoon readers deserve to enjoy the plot and characters the way we did.. like the webtoon readers will write comments which are rhetorical questions, where ppl who do not know the story discuss their own theories. If we just straight away tell them what will happen, we'll be ruining it for them!!"
43,"Apr 14, 2021",Imagine fighting some guy and he starts rambling about your past
43,"Apr 14, 2021","""WHO ARE YOU?"" ...your biggest fan 🤕"
43,"Apr 15, 2021",Okay now kiss.
43,"Apr 15, 2021","Right now I’m in one of the hardest stages in my life and it feels like reading has kept me sane and alive, I can relate"
43,"Apr 14, 2021","I'm actually tearing up a bit because of all the spoilers Dokja has said. I feel like he doesn't actually hate him that much. I feel like, he actually loves Joonghyuk's character but hated him after things got real. lol Idk. "
43,"Apr 14, 2021","OMG AAAAAAAAAAA THIS IS SO PAINFUL TO READ IT HURTS IT HURTS😭😭 KIM DOKJA SURVIVED THANKS OF WOS/TWSA HE LIVED JUST TO WITNESS THE END OF THE NOVEL HE STRUGGLED BUT HE'S ALIVE AND IT'S ALL THANKS TO YOO JOONGHYUK, YJH SAVED HIM😭 AND NOW KDJ'S RETURNING THE FAVOR"
43,"Apr 22, 2021",Joonghyuk: I'm all alone  Dokja: You dense mf
43,"Apr 14, 2021",I love how he has cooking Lv. 10 on top of all those other things
43,"May 14, 2021",did joonghyuk just get his life spoiled 
43,"Apr 15, 2021",why is no one commenting about junghyeok's level 10 cooking skills ☹️
43,"Apr 14, 2021","“I was with you the whole time!!! I’m your ultimate fanboy, don’t you know that?!” "
43,"Apr 14, 2021","Wahhh Prophets when are you coming?? (I am waiting for the SSSSS-grade character, for those who understand me) And I can’t stop loving Dokja’s character. He is so smart and fearless and thinks of himself as all-knowing LOL, but he knows his weakness, which makes him a great character. He would also do anything he can to save his companions (I respect him)"
43,"Feb 24, 2021",AAAAAAAAAAA WAS HE LISTENING? OH MY GOD!! WHAT'LL HAPPEN IF EVERYTHING COMES TO LIGHT??
43,"May 12, 2021","this chapter really shows that no matter the disses, jonghyuk is really dokja's favourite character. The fact that he's pretty much one of the, if not most significant, reasons dokja kept surviving all this time is, it's really not something that's easily describable. He's rooting for the man and to see his fav character break down like that must've hurt"
43,"Apr 21, 2021","Dokja sounded really hurt when Jungheok said he was alone. Dokja was with him all along (as a reader) they suffered and survived together, in a way..."
43,"Apr 14, 2021",Wait wait wait HOLD UP!!! YJH had a CHILD?!?! And it died?!?! This is the first time they are telling us this thing right? BACKSTORY PLEASE?!?!
43,"Apr 14, 2021","don't be suspicious, don't be suspicious"
43,"Feb 26, 2021","Funfact: The sunfish is a reference from a game where you should keep the sunfish from dying and also, it grows stronger than its past life. Its basically Yu Junghyeok Lol *The game called 'Surprise mola mola' or something*"
43,"Jul 6, 2021",don't be SUSPICIOUS don't be SUSPICIOUS don't be SUSPICIOUS don't be SUSPICIOUS don't be SUSPICIOUS don't be SUSPICIOUS don't be SUSPICIOUS don't be SUSPICIOUS don't be SUSPICIOUS don't be SUSPICIOUS don't be SUSPICIOUS don't be SUSPICIOUS don't be SUSPICIOUS don't be SUSPICIOUS don't be SUSPICIOUS don't be SUSPICIOUS don't be SUSPICIOUS don't be SUSPICIOUS don't be SUSPICIOUS don't be SUSPICIOUS don't be SUSPICIOUS don't be SUSPICIOUS don't be SUSPICIOUS don't be SUSPICIOUS don't be SUSPICIOUS 
43,"May 16, 2021","Donkja: OH, How I know that..uhm..yeah we don't talk about that."
43,"Apr 15, 2021","I love how Jonghyuk's highest stat is Cooking, at lvl. 10 😂 🥰"
43,"Apr 15, 2021","While everyone's talking about the amazing ending, does anyone think that the Cinema Master looks like a deranged Walt Disney? No? just me? ok I'll leave."
43,"Apr 14, 2021",did he just call him a damn sunfish
43,"Apr 14, 2021","""I too, kept reading so that I could survive."" if this isn't me this pandemic and my relationship with line webtoon lol"
43,"Apr 14, 2021",Guess his second regression was a slice of life cooking manwha with that cooking skill
43,"Apr 14, 2021","Dokja: ""I'm... your biggest fan."" *pulls out posters and merch of Junghyeok*"
43,"Apr 14, 2021",Respect for the author for explaining the meme before using it (and for making this amazing comic but also for that)
43,"Mar 13, 2021","We did it!!! We finally reached the prologue panel!Not gonna lie, I was tearing up while Dokja was talking and flashes of his past reading the story. I totally understand that feeling o being alone and only relying on a story to completion to keep me going every day."
43,"Apr 14, 2021","Junghyeok has been through so much, man... not gonna lie, I teared up a bit"
43,"Apr 14, 2021","Dokja bro, don’t you think you went a lil overboard with the spoiling 😂"
43,"Sep 16, 2021",HE HAD A CHILD???
43,"Apr 20, 2021",So uh... I literally just started reading this a few hours ago.... and here I am.... now waiting for the next episode like a fiend... holy cow I didnt expect to get this deeply engrossed into the story... 10/10 have subscribed and need more...
43,"Apr 16, 2021",Dokja be spoilin the twsa content

43,"Apr 15, 2021",「 Dok ja is stu pid. 」
43,"Apr 15, 2021","Gotta admit, cinema dude has good taste when it comes to battle scenes."
43,"Apr 14, 2021","LOVE THIS CHAPTER. KDJ's reactions when he was reading YJH's mind and when KDJ was shouting things that happened in the novel while the panel shows his own struggles is just,,, PAIN."
43,"Apr 14, 2021",Cooking level ten I died
43,"Apr 14, 2021","I really love this scene, since it shows that Dokja's relationship with TWSA and it characters is much more than just the only reader of a bad novel. "
43,"Apr 14, 2021",HE HAD A LOVER?!?!?!
43,"Apr 14, 2021","dokja: ""I'm a reader"""
43,"Apr 14, 2021","does that mean even as a regressor, junghyeok never met dokja? that's why he's so confused/suspicious of him? 😳 hoo that is interesting!"
43,"Apr 14, 2021",Everyone after Dokja’s monologue: Uh... who are you???
43,"Mar 27, 2021",I didn’t know Jungheok yu was so powerful... I mean look at his cooking skill! It level 10! Most men probably ar at level 2 or 1 smh
43,"Mar 16, 2021",btw when will he wear his white coat
43,"Mar 13, 2021","Dokja had the Opportunity to hit Junghyeok two times a day, I bet he enjoyed every single bit of it ;)"
43,"Feb 26, 2021",dojka is the king of over sharing lmao
43,"Feb 24, 2021",Yes!!!! The fight scene from the prologue!!! YJH vs KDJ showdown!!!
43,"Feb 24, 2021",not another week of suffering
43,"May 15, 2021",Oh sir. I'm just a stalker. A poor stalker who tried to survive school bullies by read TwSa. And- JY : sHaDdAp *Sword flashes over to my neck-*
43,"Apr 16, 2021",I like how the strongest attack was with him awake
43,"Apr 15, 2021",Ugh. Why do i ship them fufu
43,"Apr 15, 2021","dunno about others but for me, reading novels is whats keot me going for quite a bit of time nowas pathetic as that may be, reading about this characters is a relief for me 
so thank the translators and authors out there, you did a really good job"
43,"Apr 15, 2021",Amazing chapter! This confrontation was very emotional. I love characters having shared struggles. And the “snap out of it” trope is something very dear to me. And I just love people being each other’s “saviors”. (Bonus points for that promo pic finally happening and for the sunfish thing being explained!)
43,"Apr 14, 2021",For other characters Dokja may start looking like constellation who watched Joonghyuk's previous attempts 🤔
43,"Apr 14, 2021",My favourite personal skill he has is his lvl 10 cooking.
43,"Apr 14, 2021",I’m more worried about the constellations finding out than the people
43,"Jun 21, 2021",YOOO I’m actually crying this was such a good episode 
43,"Jun 11, 2021","that's so heartbreaking...imagine repeating things over and over again, existing alone is already sucks damn"
43,"Jun 4, 2021","this episode makes me emotional. as a reader, I too, read to escape the cruel reality we all are living in"
43,"May 14, 2021","Dokja's face when Junghyeuk is doing his emo angsty ""I'm all alone"" thing is priceless"
43,"Apr 15, 2021",dokja just spoiled the entirety of twsa without a warning :/ rude 
43,"Apr 15, 2021","junghyeok yus best personal Skill: cooking lvl 10, what else so we need for this man to be perfect😍 "
43,"Apr 15, 2021",dokja just spoiled the whole series smh
43,"Apr 14, 2021","Oh wow, the final panel when both Dokja and Jungyeok clashed swords was the one they put on the promotional banner for this webtoon. Amazing piece of art there, thank you author-artist."
43,"Apr 14, 2021",So how many constellations are going to catch on that he knows a little too much?
43,"Apr 14, 2021","Damn, he called him a sunfish."
43,"Feb 24, 2021",HES DOKJA KIM THE OMNIESCENT READER. (roll credits)
43,"Nov 16, 2021",“I too kept reading so that I could survive” 🥺😭
43,"Jun 20, 2021",I just want to go n give him a hug...u r not alone junghyeok now that kim dokja is there 
43,"Jun 8, 2021",And the cup of the biggest spoiler goes to Mr Kim Dokja
43,"May 12, 2021",yo! wtf is with this chapter? i'm tearing up as well!
43,"May 12, 2021",lmao this is so much funnier after reading chapter 46-
43,"Apr 17, 2021","Just want to mention that the webtoon is accurately going chapter by chapter so far, and if we go at the same pace we will have around 500 chapters left to go. Good luck to the artists, the story just keeps getting better!"
43,"Apr 16, 2021","this fighting scene is on 🔥 ""I GOT HIM it was more like I grazed him"" 😂"
43,"Apr 16, 2021",I swear every time i catch up on a comic i always end at the biggest cliffhanger....
43,"Apr 15, 2021","By Aliens they mean 'Outer Gods'. Lame translation on various terminologies including many of the names of those skills. Those skill names all sound pretty cool in Korean but many of them got translated to something very stupid sounding names with very unrelated meaning to the original names. Hard to understand why if there's already a finished, translated novel that has pretty descent translated terminologies with very related meaning to the original names."
43,"Apr 15, 2021",Dokja be like spitting out spoilers here and there 😆😆😆
43,"Apr 15, 2021",I wish I had coinnnnsss 😔
43,"Apr 14, 2021",Dokja fucking spoiled the whole thing >:( 
43,"Apr 14, 2021","....did anyone else notice that amongst all his other skills, he's also a great cook?"
43,"Mar 5, 2021",I want an omake where the constellations are all up in the comments sharing their fan theories on Dokja and Junghyeok’s mysterious connection  jejejeje
43,"Feb 24, 2021",that was a dope ass fight. I cant wait to see all the later fights it gets so epic! one of the only stories iv read that never has a  dull moment I'm so excited this is being inked!
43,"Oct 16, 2021",He mentioned the mc once had a child...A CHILD 👦🌝
43,"Sep 25, 2021",this... this chapter broke me 😭 Junghyeok has had and will have such a tough life... the part about his child broke me
43,"Sep 25, 2021",I had to reread this chapter. This was powerful. They really did the novel justice with this chapter. Especially the last panel. 
43,"Aug 10, 2021",Poor Jonghyuk he went through all that.  AND HE WAS A DAD?!
43,"Jun 9, 2021",A”thank you for waking me up” would be nice 
43,"Jun 9, 2021",Lmao every time I see TWSA i pronounce it as one word (Tea -wah -sahh)
43,"May 18, 2021","“I, too...” [shows a scene of Dokja being alone]. I literally read in my mind, “I’m alone.” 😭👏"
43,"May 12, 2021",okay so no one's gonna talk about junghyeok yu having a child???
43,"May 5, 2021","reading to survive, that got me tear eyed and I took a moment. that's what all the webtoons I read help me with."
43,"Apr 29, 2021",why do I feel like the author actually made the story for him?? idk just a gut coz they are way too similar 
43,"Apr 19, 2021",Joonghyuk has a kid......just a reminder 🤚😃
43,"Apr 17, 2021","this chapter tearing my heart out, read the webnovel and be like Dokja."
43,"Apr 16, 2021",lmao look at dokja's face when yjh said that he's all alone😂 that was a look of pure betrayal similar to when your best friend asks when your birthday is😂
43,"Apr 16, 2021",this chapter gave me goose bumps all the way through 
43,"Apr 15, 2021","LMAO the pannel after ""I'm alone ""😭😂"
43,"Apr 15, 2021",...Cooking lvl10... Nani????
43,"Apr 14, 2021",Can we just take a moment to appreciate the art- ITS SO BEAUTIFUL-
43,"Apr 14, 2021",it's hilarious to me that this is such an emotional and meaningful moment but junghyuk must be so creeped out
43,"Apr 14, 2021",Aliens... No why. That translation hurts too much...
43,"May 12, 2021",Wowwww this is some emotional shit.... but I love it
43,"May 8, 2021",I just came back to see that it's now Outer Gods instead of Aliens!👏🙂 I'm really happy now
43,"May 6, 2021",That last panel is wallpaper worthy
43,"Apr 29, 2021",THIS EPISODE WAS SO EMOTIONALL... Was I the only one tearing up when Dokja was delivering that epic speech to him?
43,"Apr 22, 2021",oh god hes dead now- he said a litte too much-

43,"Apr 29, 2021",I SHIP THEM HARD 🤧
43,"Apr 28, 2021",A hint: Lee Jihye is hearing all this conversation between Dokja and Jonghyuk. And she also have an overactive imagination. Her brain is cooking some good shit. Big shit actually.
43,"Apr 27, 2021",dokja's anger is me while watching re:zero and subaru is going through his emo phase
43,"Apr 25, 2021","Junghyeok: ""I'm alone."" / Dokja: And I took that personally"

43,"Apr 15, 2021",Hahaha he's so dead lol
43,"Apr 15, 2021","Wow, that was a greatttttt scene just from a storytelling standpoint. I can see Dokja’s character arc taking off and them two’s relationship coming together...I think. It just all so beautifully written and the art from the fight scene 😩. I’m new to comics/anime but I KNOW this is good."

43,"Apr 15, 2021",Just realized this is the scene from the prologue! Man I’m so excited!!
43,"Apr 15, 2021","I'll be honest, I kind of forgot that he read the series because he was such a huge fan and spent years rooting for the other characters. His interactions with everyone- manipulating people and agitating Jhongyuk, forming a rivalry, etc- I kind of forgot he actually liked these people before meeting them back when they were just fictional and he didn't have to actually deal with their mental issues."
43,"Apr 15, 2021","He really went ""i have no friends"" kim dokja ""bish what am i a roach"""
43,"Apr 15, 2021","hehe, he told secrets aloud that no one else should know"

43,"Apr 15, 2021","Is TWSA an actual book? I already know there is a book this webtoon is based on, but is TWSA itself a book?"
43,"Apr 15, 2021",I fucking love this WEBTOON so much! Amazing work every bit of it
43,"Apr 15, 2021","Aaaah, Dokja basically feels he was alongside Jonghyuk through the reading of all those chapters of TWSA! That's sweet. 😚 But also, considering some of the things he listed that happened in TWSA, am I the only one now thinking 'Man, TWSA sounds like the classic fanfiction a 14 y.o. would write'? 😅"
43,"Apr 14, 2021","its so awkward to read junghyeok yu, instead of yoo junghyeok and gilyoung called dokja with just his name? i feel like it decrease the affection, should have just use hyung as usual 😔 i dont think that will make people confused, just add a note will do.."
43,"Apr 14, 2021",THIS CHAPTER HIT DIFFERENT WHEN YOU KNOW THEIR BACKSTORIES IM SOBBINGF

43,"Apr 14, 2021",Bruh did they change breaking the sky swordmanship
43,"Apr 14, 2021","This is really random, but episode 49 comes out in 49 days for me. Ironic because square root that and you get seven, which is how many weeks we have to wait. It's all coming out perfectly. [Edit: This must be a random coincidence, but I now have seven likes on this comment. How ironic.]"

43,"Apr 4, 2021",cooking level 10? how good would that meal taste?
43,"Mar 5, 2021",When I read that part in the novel I really felt sorry for Junghyeok. I can only imagine all the sadness and suffering he went through. Losing a child and the person he loved must have been extremely traumatic for him 😞
43,"Feb 24, 2021","I was caught off guard with the Reincarnation Stigma and ""aliens"" part. The stigma was supposed to be Transmission as YJH is not a reincarnator. Anyways, this is where Jihye, Huiwon l, Gilyoung and Uriel's misunderstanding begin ahahahaha"
43,"Feb 24, 2021","Uh dude he’s trying to save you, please show some respect and decency, and maybe not attack him? "
43,"Apr 14, 2021","I wasn’t prepared for his backstory to be screamed out 😨he had a child?! And it died..no wonder he’s so cold, feeling hopeless, lost, and feels alone."
43,"Apr 14, 2021","dear translators, it ain't ""ALIENS"" its ""OUTER GODS"" well yes, you were probably trying to keep it spoiler free or something, but let's hope they'll be called by their proper species name later in the story cause the novel readers are already really pressed with certain mistakes here and there 😂"
43,"Feb 24, 2021",WE FINALLY SEE THAT SCENE AAAAAAHHHH
43,"Feb 12, 2022",why is cooking his high skill
43,"Dec 17, 2021",when someone fictional is your whole life. I get. But good damn he is the only person in his fandom that must be so lonely. I normal leave lonely fandoms behind very quickly. can't imagine.
43,"Dec 13, 2021","dokja is me, oversharing trauma and depression to a stranger i just met on the internet"

43,"Apr 28, 2021",those two women are FREAKIN AMAZING!!!!!
43,"Apr 28, 2021","I think that ""Aliens"" should be changed to Outer Gods. ORV is partly based on (spoiler) Lovecraftian myths, like Azathoth or Cthulhu, which are outer gods. Translating it as Aliens is confusing. When you google Cthulhu, you can see it is described as an outer god, NOT alien. This further proves that WEBTOON didn't bother to hire an editor who actually reads the novel (at least to the epilogue), otherwise this kind of mistakes wouldn't have been made at all 😔Edit: They fixed it! Thanks ^^"
43,"Apr 27, 2021","Well,that escalated quickly. Didn't know Junghyeok Yu had a child tho.It never crossed my mind at all.I'm just gonna rearrange my thoughts and let yall continue."

43,"Feb 24, 2021","Good chapter but there are some bad mistranslations. Junghyeok should have ""Regression"" and ""Transmission"" not ""Reincarnation"". There is a pretty important distinction between the two that shows up later on. "

43,"Jan 20, 2022",I'd kill (bugs only) to see this in anime with Korean dubs and English subs.
43,"Dec 2, 2021",I love how mad dokja gets when the sunfish says he is alone 😂😂…his face is like: what THE HELL ARE YOU SAYING?!?!???
43,"Dec 1, 2021",Now KISS!!!!!
43,"Nov 30, 2021",i want to appreciate how this comic is so well written... its weird and mind blowing. in the sense that it makes you feel like you skipped 300 episodes of the story but at the same time things actually make sense!!! i enjoy how everything abt jeonghyeok is being pieced back together (i would love to have ready abt the part where he had a child :c) and its only been 42 episodes :0 like what??! its a fast paced story so every episode after the prologue is satisfying. SUCH AN AMAZING PLOT <3
43,"Sep 11, 2021",Yo spoilers. But damn the line where he said he reads to survive really resonates with me 
43,"Sep 10, 2021","Lmao I’m rereading this for the like fifteenth time but I remember in the prologue at the beginning I used to think that he was a person in the future or something of Dokja since they looked the same but he was older lmao, I was so wrong "
43,"Sep 2, 2021",did the MC just drop spoilers about the MC ??
43,"Aug 28, 2021","wtf is blue star weapon aura 😭 this translation is killing me, where’s Breaking the Sky Swordsmanship..."
43,"Aug 26, 2021",how to marry a drawing style 💔
43,"Aug 18, 2021","Well, this is a first. If you ever read other isekai webtoons or something with the protagonist having read a book, you know that every single one of them tries to hide that they are a transmigrator. Well that is except for Dokja Kim, who just screamed the spoilers to everyone."
43,"Aug 7, 2021",man i love dokja a Lot :/
43,"Aug 6, 2021",i always wonder why cooking is almost out of place among his skills..but who wouldn't love a man who can cook? yes! you fine man... hoping he'd join tha dokja faction now

43,"Jun 24, 2021","ugh novel readers giving spoilers here and there.. if indonesian site, i know they really love spoilers. but their spoilers are pleasant to read - they didnt spoil something far away, only spoil the near future like literally what happen, they didnt spoil anything that will spoil the fun..while reading the spoilers in english site are just like being mocked for not knowing, or they spoil something so far away or something too important "
43,"Jun 17, 2021",Dokja saying all the stuff that Junhyeuk yu went through hits so hard! 
43,"Jun 11, 2021",at least he wake up

43,"May 5, 2021",Would be real funny if he pecked his forehead rn
43,"May 4, 2021",This WEBTOON to me is like twsa is to him it really help me get through though times

43,"May 3, 2021",Dokja did a full Naruto *😂
43,"May 3, 2021",Man exposed himself to the constellations 
43,"May 3, 2021","Damn Dokja, you should have said ""spoiler alert!"" lmao. But on a serious note, I feel bad for the both of them "
43,"May 2, 2021",Hmm? I think this is in the prologue
43,"May 2, 2021",Dokja be dishing out those spoilers right now lol
43,"May 2, 2021",Basically this story has two OP swordsman protagonists with the power of hindsight
43,"May 1, 2021","The ultimate fuckup was tryna not get fucked up by the wrathing fuckup who got caught by a physically weak yet mentally strong fucker, just to fuckup and say the wrong fucking thing. Well fuck.... "

43,"Apr 27, 2021",If I were them I would probably think that Dokja is a constellation that decided to go in the game
43,"Apr 27, 2021",*silently boards a ship*
43,"Apr 27, 2021",This was a beautiful episode. The emotions were so real.

43,"Apr 26, 2021","Makes me tear up again... this is just like the relationship us readers have with our favorite characters, and how they serve as our light in times when life is too hard to carry on..."

43,"Jul 25, 2022",I wonder if his LV10 cooking ability will ever come in handy-
43,"May 2, 2022","Dokja... that's true, even after all the struggles in this world, in the end of the day, all your worries suddenly disappear the moment you continue reading your favorite novel (〒﹏〒)"

43,"Nov 8, 2021","This chapter was so good...I loved the interspersed EXASPERATED facial expressions from Dokja when Junghyeok was being emo 😭😂😂 This chapter is honestly relatable, like imagine rooting for your favorite character and seeing them grow and become strong over time...just for them to give up at the end. HOW FRUSTRATING would that be? I can understand Dokja's feelings"
43,"Nov 2, 2021","i read this chapter with Legends never Die by Against the current playing in the background. this is one awesome chapter. thank you author, thank you artist! 😇✊"

43,"Aug 24, 2021","Dokja’s feelings, that’s a true reader’s feelings. We live in our fav books, we live with the characters in these books. True readers fight with these characters, laugh and cry with them, experience every event, every emotional moment with them. And when the story end we feel like we knew them for centuries or sometimes like we have lost a precious friend."
43,"May 31, 2021",I hope there will be an anime series for this. The art is so cool
43,"May 14, 2021",I feel like dokja and junghyeuk are the same people. only a theory tho.
43,"Apr 19, 2021",JUST KISS HAHAHAHAH JK
43,"Apr 18, 2021","you dumb sunfish, he's your soulmate. your life and death partner."
43,"Apr 15, 2021",Yoo Jonghyuk x Kim Dokja and that's FINAL!💕💕💕💕💕👨‍❤️‍👨
43,"Apr 14, 2021","somebody please tell me in the face that shipping them is wrong on so many levels and I should just forget about my imaginary gay tension I lack in my life
or please tell me I'm not alone and send me titles of fanfics about them. i'm just a bad person there's nothing much to talk about no one can change me I WANT TO KNOOOW I SHIP THEM SO MUUCH"
43,"Apr 14, 2021","i have a theory that dokja is a a constilation, thats why hes able to see the future and how he watched everything, like hes a constellation for the fututre
edit: i think this way because hes read the comic like what a cobstelation does they watch the battles but he read it since thats what he likes "
43,"Apr 14, 2021",Omg are they about to kiss rn 👀
43,"Apr 14, 2021",damn the mc himself spoil the story 😂
43,"Feb 24, 2021",BRUHHHHHHHHH IM SO MUCH MORE EXITED TO COUNT DOWN THESE EPISODES!!!! also am I the only one that doesn't hate him anymore 😅😅😅 3107
43,"Oct 7, 2022","Yea he basically exposed himself, but those feels tho. I too have yearned for the fictional character and felt inspired. This fight ia basically therapy lol. "
43,"Sep 28, 2022",Yjh : I'm all alonedojka : bitch what am I a roach!!??
43,"Sep 22, 2022",When he (kdj) punched him (mc) it somehow felt satisfying 
43,"Aug 13, 2022","So uh.. Why's he saying he's ""the only one left alive""...?"
43,"Aug 8, 2022",yo its a parallel to the prologue
43,"Aug 5, 2022",did he just exposed his self and spoiled the entire plot???😭😭😭 
43,"Jul 27, 2022",The fact that Dokja exposed himself AND called Jonghyuk a Sunfish (a weakling)
43,"Jul 22, 2022",did anyone else notice jonghyuks level 10 in cooking🤣
43,"Jul 5, 2022","Dokja:*sees his attacks aren't doing much* ""Time to pull out the big guns...... TALK NO JUTSU!!"" "
43,"Jul 5, 2022","""I, too... kept reading so that I could survive"" this line hits so hard "
43,"Jul 3, 2022","""who are you?"" no one, just someone who's been simping for you for ten years now"
43,"Jun 19, 2022",NO NO NO NO I READ IT WRONG RIGHTT????!!!!NO HE DID NOT HAVE A CHILD!!
43,"May 31, 2022","yall, he said jongyeok had a child!?"
43,"May 15, 2022",oh to be his first love
43,"May 12, 2022",I don’t know if this was intentional ( I doubt it was) but the fact that it looks like they’re about to start fighting with lightsabers is the best thing I’ve ever seen. Also the correlations with how they both struggled to survive us so cool and I can’t wait to see how the story progresses further! <333
43,"May 12, 2022",Dokja did you just spoiled the whole plot to us
43,"Apr 8, 2022",cooking level 10? 
43,"Apr 8, 2022",dokja be giving us spoilers 
43,"Apr 1, 2022","im dokja kim bastard, nice to remeet you."
43,"Mar 10, 2022","the fight was totally epic! and the ""WHO ARE YOU?"" it was the finishing touch"
43,"Feb 7, 2022",I think this is one of my favorite episodes so far...
43,"Jan 30, 2022",A CHILD ????? he really just exposed his whole being 
43,"Jan 20, 2022","EYYYYY isnt this that scene in the prologue? 😆 man it's so cool to finally arrive at the scene one has been teased with, now knowing the context... I wonder how it's gonna be now tho that Dokja spilled everything... 👀 also hhhh what's Dokja and Gilyeong's plan......"
43,"Jan 19, 2022","Dokja: Uhh yeaahhh... So we'll discuss that one later, but why don't you stop fucking attacking me?"
43,"Jan 18, 2022","damn, this gave me the feels 😞"
43,"Jan 18, 2022",he has a CHILD??? 😲 anyway i still ship them 
43,"Jan 15, 2022",Dokja: “dont be suspicious dont be suspicious- ah damn it”
43,"Jan 6, 2022","this should be an anime! i want to watch this on live action"""
43,"Dec 31, 2021",wow dokja... I can't believe you... you.. spoiled the story... NOOOOO—
43,"Dec 27, 2021",finally we have reached the prologue 
43,"Nov 28, 2021",jonghyuk's regression depression arc xD
43,"Nov 22, 2021",the tension
43,"Nov 21, 2021",“Who are you?” The new protagonist of your story!!!
43,"Nov 20, 2021",dokja: ur mom
43,"Nov 18, 2021",biTch im crying

43,"Oct 19, 2021",not one panel disappoints me! ghad this story!
43,"Oct 14, 2021",Caught in 4K 📸 
43,"Sep 8, 2021",Those are some badass ladies! Ahhh hell yeah. It's that scene from the prologue!! I thought it would be farther along in the series. That means there's a lot more to be discovered.
43,"Sep 8, 2021",Woah! Those spoilers Dokja! I wonder if it's Anna Croft or another prophet that will betray him. Junghyeok also used to have much more noble goals so the man must have suffered a lot through his past lives to grow so cold. He's going to fall in love and have a child only to lose it. I wonder how many times he's lost companions and loved ones. I wonder how Dokja will change the story. He doesn't have the luxury of regression so he has to do things perfectly the first time
43,"Sep 4, 2021",AGAHAHAH I'M SORRY BUT DOKJA'S FACE THE PANEL AFTER JUNGHYEOK SAID THAT HE WAS ALL ALONE OFTTTT
43,"Aug 31, 2021",BRO IM TEARING UP

43,"Aug 20, 2021",Ok . now I need to know who did Joonghyuk made a kid with
43,"Aug 18, 2021",Who would've thought Junghyeok was going to be dad. I feel like we heard something we weren't suppose to. 👀
43,"Aug 14, 2021",love the funfact about sunfish and our sunfish ❤️
43,"Aug 4, 2021","Damn, Jonghyuk went through it for like 3,000+ chapters"
43,"Jul 30, 2021",i read top comments that the prologue is near... wdym by prologue isnt done already?!??? i mean we're already in ch50+ omg what is happening
43,"Jul 29, 2021","""WHO ARE YOU?!?!??""...   Your worst nightmare "
43,"Jul 15, 2021",who remembers that scene back in the first episode that had this
43,"Jul 2, 2021","PROLOGUE TIME- I see I see, I didn't expect it to happen during a dungeon where they were planning on saving him, that's very interesting...also Dokja totally revealed all his cards and his personal attachment to the story (it was with him his whole life and picked him up when he felt down after all) and the mc, in some ways. Nice. Now...what will happen now?"
43,"Jun 4, 2021",That’s the cover! Oh I see what you did there author I see what you did.

43,"Apr 15, 2021",didn't he just expose everything to the constellations
43,"Aug 9, 2022","umm.. That wasn't rational at all. I expected him to be more calm and calculative. It's not like he's dying or anything. Now you spouted some unbelievable unnecessary nonsense which makes the constellation, crew, bheyong everyone suspicious of your origin. I mean why tf would you expose yourself WTF"

43,"Apr 14, 2021",why is it so slow herez? Another website has already published chapter 51.....
43,"Apr 14, 2021","Yeah ima call bullshit on him always being good and just, did he get dealt a bad hand? Yes, is he well meaning? Maybe but he’s a ducking sociopath at best."
43,"Feb 24, 2021","What I dislike about the main character, is that none of his abilities feel consistent or cohesive. He has no clear path of development. In the novel, at the most convenient times, he would pull single use items and tactics that would either break or lose their capability after being used once out of his ass at to save the day. It began to annoy me after a while and this is far from the last time this happens. This webtoon is nothing more than an interesting premise and lackluster execution."
