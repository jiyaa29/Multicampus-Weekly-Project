 Kim Dokja about Yoo Jungheok : Eyebrows seemingly drawn by a single, uninterrupted stroke of a famed artist’s brush; a nose and a chin shaped in perfect angles that defied attempts to measure them through mere devices of men; a pair of deep eyes seemingly carved out of a beautiful jewel containing all the misf-

 Also Kim Dokja to Yoo Jungheok : ugly mug. "
30,"Nov 25, 2020",By far the most broken thing Yoo Junghyuk has is that lvl 10 cooking skill. By far the most plot breaking ability. Nerf please

30,"Nov 25, 2020","Huiyon didn't even FLINCH when junghyuk stared her down despite dokja obviously trying to be cautious around him. Heck, she might've even fought him if dokja didn't intervene. What a badass (or dumbass lol, very fine line tbh). I love it. My fave character indeed"
30,"Nov 25, 2020","""ugly mug"" thats rich coming from someone who always talk about how hot yjh is, dokja"

30,"Jan 13, 2021",the fact this is just the ep 29 and it has been 6 month. make me think this is going to take 10 years to be finished. so basically we are going to be dokja
30,"Jan 7, 2021",This whole chapter was basically two emo dudes wanting to kill each other
30,"Jan 8, 2021",Junghyeok why is ur answer to everything to kill on sight
30,"Dec 2, 2020",Junghyeok Yu is like nobody gonna deprive anyone of going to the restroom.

30,"Dec 1, 2020",Hear me out Hear me out: Junghyeok Yu is interested in the smart short kid at the station.. I mean it would make sense right
30,"Jan 13, 2021","what really made me laugh was them adding ""ugly mug"" into the translation out of Nowhere. originally the line is just him admitting to staring. they probably added in ""ugly mug"" for one of two reasons. option one is to try and convey the informal tone that kdj uses with yjh. option two is to try (in vain) to make the line seem less like kdj Checking Out yjh lmao. honestly? probably both"
30,"Jan 13, 2021","Dokja and Junghyeok Yu are such Assholes to each other, I love it 😂😂😂"

30,"Jan 13, 2021","The funny part is that YJH told him to punch him if he dared, yet he activated his shield LMAO"
30,"Jan 14, 2021",I love how Wukong gifted him coins for insulting someone.
30,"Jan 14, 2021","As an original reader, I literally cannot emphasis it enough when I say that this is just the beginning of the story....there is SO much that happens and I cannot wait for you guys to get to those parts 😭"
30,"Jan 13, 2021",How tf are these people still alive like I wouldn't be able to leave the subway I would just lay down on the broken bridge and let the snake monster thingy consume me :))

30,"Jan 13, 2021",Why do I ship Dokja and Junghyeok so much😭
30,"Jan 13, 2021",Dokja’s level of passive aggressiveness all the time on top of the pure sass gives me a reason to live

30,"Jan 18, 2021","I'm Korean and i found a wrong translation. When dokja wanted to punch junghyuk, the skill junghyuk used is not a tigergod aura. It is called 호신강기 and 호신(護身) means body defense. The translator didn't know the right  meaning of 호신. He/she understood it as 호신(虎神). Sorry for my bad english."
30,"Jan 13, 2021",One of the most chaotic relationships I've ever read.
30,"Jan 13, 2021","""justice, in most cases, is just something that is agreed upon by the majority"" what a damn truth Kim Dokja talking here. Justice is just something that favour the majority of people and leave the minority in their suffering"

30,"Nov 26, 2020","Dude, Junghyeok has a bad superiority complex. And he's a jerk. But I also understand his mindset. You can tell how this new scenario is stressing him tf out. It's gonna be very hard for him to become a team player. I hope he and Dokja don't have a Naruto & Sasuke battle where he gets the sense beat into him. (I'm lying. That would be very hype. Plz do XD)"

30,"Jan 13, 2021","""Cooking lv. 10"" I love it"
30,"Nov 25, 2020",Dokja's Squad could become a small army if they simply recruited everyone possible. However I think the novel MC might just wipe them out if he did.

30,"Nov 26, 2020",Haha the penalty is left unclear so that if Dokja fails the Dokaebi can just laugh it off and pay him on the back.
30,"Nov 26, 2020",i wish this series had two episodes per week like The Boxer
30,"Nov 26, 2020",I'm still wondering if Dokja still have a crush on Sangah 
30,"Nov 26, 2020",he complains about him being op but i think having knowledge about the scenarios and the system puts you way beyond that of an average person
30,"Nov 26, 2020",I kinda wanna see them doik it out with there fists..junghyeok would most likely be the one less injured but it would be satisfying to watch
30,"Nov 26, 2020",he is realy the omniescent reader(the all know reader)but I wonder how he remembered the entire novel he readed it like in 3 years and still Remember it all

30,"Nov 25, 2020","I'm interested to see what scheme Jung is pulling, the school survivor girl is definitely going to join dokja or leave jung when they reveal what he is really about at the end if this scenario. I also don't think Jung was alarmed by our evil slaying wife I think it was the kid and his extraordinary ability to commune with so many types of creatures. a skill that could be refined into many uses. Even his co worker being able to translate creatures and languages is amazing "
