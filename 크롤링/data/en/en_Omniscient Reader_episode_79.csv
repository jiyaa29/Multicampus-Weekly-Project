Episode,Date,Review
79,"Nov 17, 2021",Hmm I admit they’re both suspicious. Better be safe and marry both of them 
79,"Nov 17, 2021","Sangah scares me because she really valued human life and didn't want to kill people until she realized that even a child was okay with it...now she takes out DOZENS of people like it's nothing. That kind of change is terrifying and a bit sad, although it is definitely necessary to survive. Damn...I wonder what exactly she had to go through "
79,"Nov 17, 2021","Always be wary of HR. First Toby becomes the Scranton Strangler, and you have Sang-Ah becoming a cutthroat assasin."
79,"Nov 17, 2021","[The constellation ""THE RED KING"" is excited that the female characters aren't relegated to healers and love interests, rather they are characters of depth with their own goals, identities, and reasons for fighting. 2000 coins have been sponsored.]"
79,"Nov 17, 2021","so i'm pretty sure the only reason people weren't becoming stronger was because dokja likes to finesse everything, alot of his actions involve work arounds and knowledge, so everyones growth was stifled abut in exchange they got knowledge which let them geow more effectively"
79,"Nov 17, 2021","Honeslty sangah worries me, she probably not even in the best mental state atm either considering how drastically she changed in a few days "
79,"Nov 17, 2021","Why all the women in this comic sus as hell, mc safer with the og mc who literally wants to one shot him..."
79,"Nov 17, 2021",Sangah became a certified badass in his absence... 
79,"Nov 17, 2021","[The constellation ""Lazy Broke Weeb "" was amazed on the the massive growth of the incarnation ""ysa"" and is now suspicious on its sponsor. ][The constellation ""Lazy Broke Weeb "" warns the incarnation ""kdj"" to not be distracted and focus on the upcoming disaster.][5 coins have been sponsored. ] //Edit: Merry Christmas guys 🎅"
79,"Nov 17, 2021",When you realize that technically KDJ's the only one in their 4 Man Band that's not in black 🤣
79,"Nov 17, 2021",Can we appreciate how great sangah looks for a second?
79,"Nov 17, 2021",On this week of “WHO’S THE IMPOSTER” we’ve got Sangah who hated killing a few days ago now mass murdering with maximum efficiency. [+5 coins]
79,"Nov 17, 2021",Love that last panel. Badass ladies ready to slay em allllll
79,"Nov 17, 2021",I want what happened to Sangah that made her kill people so easily. 
79,"Nov 17, 2021",What did Sangha GO through?? She looks like it’s been rough for her these past couple days. 😭😭
79,"Nov 17, 2021","Oh my, Sangah's outfit tho"
79,"Nov 17, 2021","wow the artists really give the Yoos the most badass entrance and coolest outfit huh. talking about good genes and playing favourite lol, not that I'm complaining though, each character have their own time to shine 😅 but damn those details on the color black is hella mesmerising, the overall art improved a lot too since episode 1! and I also love how the artists give each character their own details, it adds certain depth in the story"
79,"Nov 17, 2021",Holy crap! Looks like Sangha has enrolled in The Natasha Romanov School of Fashion and Kickassery 😁
79,"Nov 17, 2021",2 dangerous woman at dokja's command 😳😳
79,"Nov 17, 2021","I mean I think Dokja should be careful of them both, not just one lol these women could kill him at any moment "
79,"Nov 17, 2021","Ok. At the beginning of the comic, I knew the artist intended to make Sangah busty, but humble. This is just plain mobius curves I'm witnessing"
79,"Nov 17, 2021",I really hope Sangah stays true to Dokja...
79,"Nov 17, 2021",Sangah looks so tired though. Poor woman
79,"Nov 17, 2021",I LOVE STRONG WOMEN !!!
79,"Nov 17, 2021",I forgot how to breath for a second. 
79,"Nov 17, 2021",Is her constellation a greek hero? Theseus maybe. He used the thread before right? 
79,"Nov 17, 2021","man tbf its really hard to judge who's trustworthy, esp in an apocalypse"
79,"Nov 17, 2021","OK so now we know she has hermes as a constalation and the strong must be from hermeses lyre. she also uses daggers but for that im assuming it comes from the fact hermes ruled over wealth, good fortune, commerce, fertility, and thievery. it would explain everything else.  let it also be noted hermes is also very well known as a trickster"
79,"Nov 17, 2021",Someone sold her soul to the Devil It seems... Curious to find out!
79,"Nov 23, 2021","Everyone be like suspicious of YSA and HSY but damn, the most suspicious one is really Kim Dokja. If this was in another character's perspective, KDJ would be the mysterious character who ends up being MADly overpowered. "
79,"Dec 22, 2021",Jungheok just helplessly sitting on the floor had me dead 😂.
79,"Dec 22, 2021",Yu Junghyeok in the background:🧎”I sits”
79,"Nov 25, 2021",i like how the 2 supporting women aren't healers or love interests for once🙏🏼
79,"Nov 18, 2021","everyone saying she's sus and dokja should be wary - I'm hardpressed to distrust her so quickly. sure she' might have some new secrets, but she's been earnest and loyal from the start. the first disciple, on the other hand, has had ulterior motives from the start"
79,"Dec 22, 2021",sangah got the boob belt but junghyeok didnt (｡•́︿•̀｡)
79,"Nov 17, 2021","There definitely is something more to Sangah's change. For her not only to improve so much, but also become so accustomed to killing. I hope she remains a positive character, since there are so few of them. On a side note, Sangah with the first disciple look so badass together at the end there"
79,"Dec 22, 2021","non novel readers : sangah kinda sus… some novel readers : YOOO THE GIRLFRIENDS, HSY AND YSAAAA… the other novel readers : YSA IN CATSUIT! NEXT ITS A CERTAIN SOMEONE TO COSPLAY YSA IN KDJ’s FAV “dress”"
79,"Dec 22, 2021",god im so gay i love women catch me taking screenshots of every background panel of han sooyoung
79,"Nov 17, 2021",Strong women appreciation chapter
79,"Nov 17, 2021",Dokja: She's pretty well equipped.Us: Yeah she is... ;)
79,"Dec 22, 2021",I honestly think that it's on purpose that she got powered up sm in the absence of dokja..Her constellation was always secretive..
79,"Nov 17, 2021",I love suyeong and sangah’s interactions.
79,"Dec 25, 2021",Theyre both very suspicious.  Best just to avoid both of them and marry the man you've been carrying on you back and bickering with for the past two episodes.
79,"Dec 22, 2021",so is no one gonna talk about how sad and hard  it must have been to junghyeok for losing his friends over and over again. damn man really had his hopes high into believing that his lover may still recognize him
79,"Nov 23, 2021","Sangah looks tired also probably because she is using too much power from her ""constellation"" 😢"
79,"Dec 22, 2021",All this focus on Sangah and Dokja never asked about where Huiwon might be :(
79,"Nov 18, 2021","the art is getting good, it's pretty much getting along with the novel too, so far.. there are some times where some scenes doesn't show, thats fine. I love it, making webtoon readers curious enough to find the novel and read it, more detailed stuff happens to dokja before the current chapter, pretty good stuff"
79,"Nov 17, 2021","Sangah has always been unique but the author hasn't revealed the plot yet. Remember she was there from the beginning and Dokja has mentioned her mystery periodically. There's no telling who she is yet, but I do not think she's an imposter, rather we're getting some development toward her true purpose in this comic."
79,"Nov 23, 2021",Yoo Sangah my love!
79,"Nov 17, 2021",SANGAH A BADASS
79,"Dec 27, 2021",Why is sangah so hot
79,"Dec 27, 2021",wheres the child? he riding on the back on a giant mantis or something?
79,"Dec 22, 2021","""she is well equipped""
Dokja looking respectfully"
79,"Dec 22, 2021",where's my boy hyeonseong 😭
79,"Dec 22, 2021",why people being suspicious of her strength and didn't care about her highlight in this chapter? 😂 i almost die seeing her beautifulness just now lol 😆
79,"Dec 22, 2021","I think I understand what happened to Sangah. This wholw time with Dokja taking charge of everything, she'd been able to maintain a certain level of psychological distance from the carnage and mayhem. She'd been able to aoldier on under the guise that she was on some level being taken care of. But the moment she found herself on her own, she found herself having to make a choice, and she made it quickly Her sudden growth may be in part due to her mental state finally catching up to her situation"
79,"Dec 22, 2021","these two girls are suspicious, beautiful, badass, my wif-"
79,"Dec 22, 2021",Sangah × Sooyoung ISHIPIT! 
79,"Dec 22, 2021",JUST A REMINDER: Incarnations don't have to be sponsored by a constellation from the same country as them. So Sangah isn't necessarily sponsored by a South Korean constellation.
79,"Nov 28, 2021",Sangah in The tight assassin outfit be like .....💡⚡ 🔥 🔥 🔥 🔥
79,"Nov 20, 2021","I've been waiting for Sangah's return as a total badass, and I was not disappointed!! The artist depicted her just how I imagined her in the webnovel!"
79,"Nov 17, 2021","[The Constellation, LADY OF THE SINGULAR FOOTWEAR, has been shocked speechless at Sangah's transformation. Also she is loving the new outfit. 5 coins have been gifted]"
79,"Dec 29, 2021","sangah is black widow,doctor strange and Spiderman?"
79,"Dec 22, 2021",nah bc they're both suspicious 😭
79,"Dec 22, 2021",Its strange that between Seyoung a former and recent antagonist and Sangah who has been with us since the very beginning I trust Seyoung more Sangah has always been dodgy about her supporting constellation and implied that they made her promise not to tell anyone else who they are for some reason her and both Seyoung and Joonghyuk where very suspicion of her immediately
79,"Dec 22, 2021","""Wich one"" that was my exact question lol. it seems like our mc will start living some of the betrayals that Junghyeok experienced with his regressions... or will be up to him holding the group together"
79,"Dec 22, 2021",girlbosses
79,"Dec 22, 2021","kdj n yjh premarital eye contact in the panel that says ""watch out"""
79,"Dec 22, 2021","not saying that I don't trust suyeong or sangah..But , Heewon seems to be the only female character I can trust blindly without any suspicions...and it seems like suyeong has grown a lot on me..well it's natural, isn't she the one that has seen dokja in the most vulnerable times till now?"
79,"Dec 22, 2021",This series really deserves to be in the top manghwas on WEBTOON…
79,"Nov 20, 2021",excuse me while i simp over BAMF!Sangah
79,"Nov 19, 2021",Hate to admit but I'm scared of sangha now she looks terrifying 😬
79,"Dec 27, 2021",those two are either gonna murder each other or become best friends. and i'm hoping for the latter.
79,"Dec 26, 2021","i come back to this story everyday, the same way i open and close a fridge over and over hoping there’ll be new food the next time i open it💔😫😫"
79,"Dec 25, 2021","Is it just me or did Sangah get hotter? No, just me, ok.😁😍"
79,"Dec 22, 2021",suyeong is an investigator 😂
79,"Dec 22, 2021","huiwon, hyeonseong, gilyeong.. i hope you're all okay 😢"
79,"Nov 18, 2021","Sangah looks weird her values on human life vs. her actions now, the lack of light in her eyes, the flushed cheeks under her eyes brings in alot of questions about if it's really her or if her mental health went down the drain"
79,"Nov 17, 2021",Mommy Sangah can step on me any day 😏
79,"Dec 26, 2021","[Sangah attribute ""Waifu"" evolved to ""Mommy""] "
79,"Dec 26, 2021","Sangah has ascended to ""Strong Waifu"""
79,"Dec 23, 2021",suyeong and sangah enemies to lovers.kiss now

79,"Dec 22, 2021",SANGAH IS LOOKING SO FINE RN 😩😩
79,"Dec 22, 2021",like this comment if you think Sang-Ah is best girl! 
79,"Dec 22, 2021",holy shit sangah and sooyoung next to next got me asking for more
79,"Dec 22, 2021","Women. Women, right? BUT WAIT WAIT WAIT. *gestures towards ORV women* WOMEN.....who can kill you."
79,"Nov 18, 2021",Sangah is hella badass now isn't she
79,"Nov 18, 2021",And in the end it turns out Sangah was the author all along…..
79,"Nov 17, 2021","Omg, what a change, I really wonder what happened when Sangah was away.Btw she's looking soo good."
79,"Nov 17, 2021",sangah outfit looks like the female version of junghyeok's. is he also wearing a high rarity green meteorite equipment?
79,"Dec 22, 2021",I'm so gay 
79,"Jan 3, 2022",sangah in that outfit is making me feel unholy things🧎
79,"Dec 27, 2021",I just read all of this in 2 days…  something is wrong with me 
79,"Dec 27, 2021",just checking how they were adapting the novel... seems like they aren't rushing things.. gud! 
79,"Dec 27, 2021","Sangah remains awesome! And this… well, she certainly is no slouch, not with her supporter! And ninja wire really is so underrated. Leave it to Junghyuk to note an issue in the bluntest way possible. Dokja opens the way for potential, but he can’t actually help people utilize it. And yeah, the company Kim Dokja keeps certainly has extraordinary luck 😆"
79,"Dec 26, 2021",sangah may be sus but I would still simp for her 
79,"Dec 26, 2021",i miss Gilyeong :(
79,"Dec 26, 2021","… well sangah was hot before, but that new outfit… well damn I’m definitely bi"
79,"Dec 26, 2021",I have yet to see them eat their first meal out of 3 that they need to have for the scenario.
79,"Dec 24, 2021","Last panel is how you do a ""girl power"" scene, not like marvel's end game "
79,"Dec 23, 2021",A GIRL DUO
79,"Dec 23, 2021",Interesting comparison at the end. Sangah has more light shining on her but her cloths are stained with the blood of the people she’s killed. On the other hand the first disciple (can’t remember her name) has less light shined on her but her cloths have zero blood. 
79,"Dec 23, 2021",Everyone: Sangha=badass assassin!!!   Me: Are they all eating like they're supposed to by the rules of the scenario? I haven't seen them eat more than once... should I be worried? it'll all work out right surely...
79,"Dec 22, 2021",everyone saying they're both suspicious then im here like I LOVE IT WHEN WOMENN
79,"Dec 22, 2021","can't wait to see the best power couple of the whole novel, and naturaly sangha with gaterbelt"
79,"Dec 22, 2021","I think Dojka is going to crack under the immense pressure, even though the fourth wall exists. Like he has to keep the Regressor alive for him to not regress, he has to keep the First Apostle in check, he has to stop the catastrophe, he has to figure out why his former companion became so strong, all while trying to follow the plot, I think he'll start to crack"
79,"Dec 22, 2021",oh damn i really can't trust either of them but anyway that last panel they look so ..🔥 my god. girlbosses..
79,"Dec 22, 2021","i will admit that sangah is a bit,,, sus,,,, BUT i will not deny that i had a bit of a bi panic for a couple scenes..."
79,"Dec 22, 2021",Anyone else realize that mc getting rlly weak compared to his companions? I feel this story doesn’t follow the plot of “companions suck compared to mc”
79,"Dec 22, 2021",I've been waiting for this moment to say: screw you the people who think Yoo Sangah is just a pretty face 
79,"Dec 22, 2021",Dokkeabi are starting to look really cute in my eyes now 😇😈😉
79,"Dec 22, 2021",Sangah pulled a Gon and aged a few years
79,"Dec 22, 2021","oh _my _gawd _, it's just been a week and sangah is 💣?Now ,I am really curious about her constellation and why is it so secretive ..Is she example of SSS-grade talent??"
79,"Dec 22, 2021","since Sanga was using both Ariadne's and Hermes' stigmas, does she have multiple constellations? or like a group of constellations under one name? like ""Greek Gods"""
79,"Dec 22, 2021",sangsoo😔
79,"Dec 21, 2021","hey guys, you should go back to the first episode snd reread it, its crazy how far ahead the author planned some stuff. there are all of our beloved characters in the first ep, plus some that we haven't met yet! I couldn't imagine Sangah's growth from the beginning to now, its crazy to see her from the beginning again! I really hope we get to see him use the bookmark skill from early on or smth to stop the catastrophe, maybe he could use bookmark to learn the winds"
79,"Nov 18, 2021",Uh oh. The light in Sangah’s eyes are gone 
79,"Nov 17, 2021",Sang-Ah's constellation is Doflamingo how else is she good at using threads to kill people
79,"Nov 17, 2021",Damn sangah! We love seeing character upgrades!
79,"Nov 18, 2021","srry this chapter is just ship hsy x ysg material for me, can’t wait for this to b unlocked so i can ss w/o guilt "
79,"Mar 21, 2022",wait where's gilyeong? :0 hope he's still alive
79,"Jan 1, 2022",King Of A Kingless World's harem is growing
79,"Jan 1, 2022",sus! everything is sus
79,"Dec 28, 2021",Is it just me or did Sangah get a lot hotter?
79,"Dec 27, 2021",lol the characters are really cool anyways and it's cool how they all have their own growth and worth and development in the story lol it makes it much better anyways this is cool 
79,"Dec 27, 2021",yo where is that small insect kid?? he’s alive right?
79,"Dec 27, 2021",Go off queens 👑
79,"Dec 26, 2021","1. I knew my baby Sang Ah was gonna be a badass the moment she received blessings from a benevolent constellation2. she said ""I AM HERE!!! AND SICK OF THIS ISH!!""
3. YAAAAAAAAS WE STAN QWEEN"
79,"Dec 25, 2021",Two girls fighting each other means enemies to lovers y’all /hj
79,"Dec 25, 2021",hmmm if i remember correctly that mr rich in the beginning got impregnated will he be coming back later in the series though? I'm very wary of him
79,"Dec 24, 2021","Kim Dokja: I’m such a quiet, awkward person, I prefer to observe and stay in the background, you know? try to stay out of trouble //Also Dokja: *constantly gets in trouble and pisses off higher beings*"
79,"Dec 24, 2021","Sangah is SUS, now I remembering that her constelation bought a plot armor for her in first scenario creating a bridge. If I could bet, it's not only 1 but a group acting together like a association"
79,"Dec 24, 2021","Dokja you should be asking the important questions, WHERE IS THE CHILD??? "
79,"Dec 23, 2021",SANGSOO MOMENT LET'S GIVE IT UP FOR WOMEN!!!!!!!! 
79,"Dec 23, 2021","I just want to say, although this webtoon is a blast, the webnovel is also, and not only that it's like around 500 chapters ahead of the webtoon, and it's GREAT. i really reccomend everyone to try reading it because it's not actually too heavy of a reading material even though it's long (it isn't description heavy at all!), and you can read it in tandem of waiting for new webtoon  chapters to come. I mean, the entire novel's finished - why wait around with the webtoon?"
79,"Dec 22, 2021","""Is that Sangah?"" how did-? When did-? "
79,"Dec 22, 2021",Damn the last panel… 🤩🤩 they are both so cool. Dokja please move aside so I can see the women at work better. 
79,"Dec 22, 2021","I guessed that her constellation is Arachne, but maybe I was wrong. The curse of Arachne was inflicted by Athena and Sangah can use one(?) of Hermes' stigma. The only individual that comes to mind is Perseus, the hero who adored by the gods. Hermes gave him winged sandals, Athena gave him a reflective shield, Hephaestus gave him sword and, Hades gave him the cap of invisibility. I even thought that it's the rope from Korean folktale of sun, moon and tiger."
79,"Dec 22, 2021",Whoa it so amazing that Sangah improve but something doesnt add quite right like how did she improve really quick in just like a few days?? i say that pretty sus and im also wondering what her constellation is?
79,"Dec 22, 2021",She's pretty well equipped 😏😏😏
79,"Dec 22, 2021",... can she tie me up and step on me please?
79,"Dec 22, 2021",my love for this series and characters esp.dokja is becoming more and more immesurable
79,"Dec 22, 2021","may or may not have professed my love for sangah multiple times this episode, but really i dont feel great about this situation, i mean on the surface she seems like sangah... without the mercy part-but she really FEELS different and i dunno what kinda underlying tone im picking up from this. I hope its not betrayal, i DEFINITELY hope its not death, atleast let her be on our side cmon now grant me my wish thats best girl right there..."
79,"Dec 22, 2021",Now I'm wondering about the huge character change in Sangah. Something seems to be there as she seemed genuinely happy to know about Pildu but something great must have happened for her to have such a radical change
79,"Dec 22, 2021",omg seeing Sangah reminded me of the kid. I forgot his name but I wonder where he is 🥲🥲
79,"Dec 22, 2021",Those clothes be looking tight.  Nothing wrong there but 🥵
79,"Dec 22, 2021",I sure hope Gilyeong is doing okay right now....
79,"Dec 22, 2021",now hear me out on sangah
79,"Dec 22, 2021",Ngl...I didn't even recognize her in the beginning and they were only separated from each other for a couple of days?!? What happened?!?
79,"Dec 12, 2021",MY GIRL LOOKS SO GOOOOOOOOOODDD
79,"Nov 22, 2021","no lie, i whispered hot mama under my breath. and im a 22 yo girl."

79,"Jan 4, 2022",I just binged 78 episodes in 4 days. And now I am sad.
79,"Jan 1, 2022",Suyoung's ability to piss off everyone and smirk is a mood 😂
79,"Jan 1, 2022","if she got op all of the sudden in such a short time, then there is only one answer for that, someone died."
79,"Dec 29, 2021","sangah became a black widow operative in 3 days. I love her so much, but I'm really sad because of that look behind her eyes. some messed up stuff happened in those 3 days"

79,"Dec 24, 2021","Oh no, she's hot..."
79,"Dec 24, 2021",Sangah is a QUEEN 👑 !!I love how she changes during the time she spent away from Dokja and even him realizes she got stronger away from him tahn she would be closer to him.

79,"Dec 23, 2021",SEEEE....... !!!!.... I KNEW IT.....!!!!.... That was Ariadne's thread.... Finally Dokja confirms my guess from the last episode 🥳🥳🥳 I bet all of the Olympus is actually backing Sangah. That's how she become freakin strong and can use all of the Olympian Gods' stigma.
79,"Dec 23, 2021",mommy? sorry. mommy?
79,"Dec 23, 2021",I wonder how that little kid is doing. The one who could talk to bugs

79,"Dec 23, 2021",dokja gay asf I would've gone crazy
79,"Dec 23, 2021","Aside from both girls being strong but suspicious, have any of them ate or drank anything for the first sub scenario?"
79,"Dec 23, 2021","I love seeing Sangah badass, but watching her be so heartless is scary. Something definitely happened while Dokja was away... 😬"

79,"Dec 22, 2021","But what if she has like, one support as the novel Dokja suggests for every character to have but still has the support of many others in some way? Uh, like a band of constellations having a certain group that could act as one? So much stretch in this thought, really but that is the only way I could think of it since she has one too many traces to be having only the support of one constellation.

"
79,"Dec 22, 2021","looks like Sangah is sitting on unstable mental and physical state during their separation. Also, she maybe got terrified by her own nightmares amd she tried to escape from it by using constellation's supporting. I hope all of them reunited again as soon as possible."

79,"Dec 22, 2021","I have some theories. 1. Sangah has been improving, but hiden her skills too 2. she only got her skills too fast with a strong suporting constelation 3. Her own suporting constelation has been sus since the beggining, there's a lot of probability that they help her to improve while somebody strong enough like Dokja was away 4. or she improved too fast by herself (trying to survive, maybe) man, I really love her, I don't even know who should I trust"

79,"Dec 17, 2021","Sangah is the author of TWSA. When she mentioned novels she played it off as real published novels but later knew he was reading web novels since she said so in a earlier chapter. Also when the main character said his character ability will update when people have reached the point of were they have read to, while hers hasn’t updated. Then there is the point when he received messages from the author on the train it showed Sangah unblurred on her phone next to him. Just my theory on it."

79,"Nov 17, 2021","I kinda feel like her supporting constellation is a Greek hero or something. Someone who got a lot of help from a lot of gods, thus her grabbag of abilities and quick growth. Maybe Perceus?"

79,"Jan 7, 2022","danggg, sangah is so cool"
79,"Jan 5, 2022",she looks so badass in that outfit!!!
79,"Jan 4, 2022",I dont think Sangah did anything malicious. I am curious about her sponsor and they most likely helped her level up the way he did.  But i also think being separated from the guiro forced her to level up bc she had no one to rely on to protect or fight along side with her. Its a jungle out there and the only she could’ve survived was to turn into a beast & quick
79,"Jan 4, 2022","I've already said way earlier that I am suspect of Sangah, I just really hope I'm wrong"

In terms of the story, I think Dokja's plan will work.  "
79,"Dec 24, 2021","okay, but what was the need to kill the survivors running away? was there some merit or did she just do it for the hell of it? bc the obvious choice would be to stop the people with the poison arrows. did she have a plan or was it dog-eats-dog world, so might as well kill anyone I see?"

79,"Dec 23, 2021","I was thinking perhaps she killed many of the people from the group she was put in charge off. Perhaps she was In a difficult situation and killed people for coins to raise her level, maybe she was forced to kill many people? She is currently alone which makes me think she was banished from the group, or she killed the group she was with. Although I'm probably very wrong."
79,"Dec 23, 2021",Sangah the author isn’t she? 
79,"Dec 23, 2021",Theory: Sangah is the author of Three Ways to Survive. It was just a bit too convenient that she was in that car with Dokja in the beginning.
79,"Dec 23, 2021","So, she got hot"

79,"Dec 23, 2021",holy crap sangah looks so dead inside now
79,"Dec 23, 2021",I think they’re both suspicious. And a strong fighter is so hot!  
79,"Dec 23, 2021",Dokja is so concerned with her power boost that he barely seems to notice that she's killing people... I'm really concerned about what happened to her. 
79,"Dec 23, 2021",ah~ this just keeps getting better and better
79,"Dec 23, 2021",I really love how both Sangha and Suyheon are independent/badass women who aren't used for fan service and aren't demoted to just healers or love interests 🥰
79,"Dec 23, 2021",Okay. Let me make this clear. Sangah was attacking Lee Seolhwa's followers aka. people trying to wake up the meteorite (aka. people who are attacking and killing off others like Dokja who are trying to prevent the awakening of the disaster and other people who just happen to be there). Doesn't change the fact that Sangah's drastically changed though.
79,"Dec 23, 2021","She’s awesome, but definitely someone to keep an eye on.  I wonder what happened exactly…"

79,"Dec 23, 2021","ngl, I completely forgot about Sang-Ah"
79,"Dec 23, 2021",come on do you really have to make her look sexy.
79,"Dec 23, 2021",Sangha is definitely suspicious...I mean in of the panels she was even looking nervous. I refuse to believe that she can take many lives just like that.....
79,"Dec 23, 2021",I wonder what exactly happened for Sangah to become this strong.
79,"Dec 23, 2021","I always wonder, when does anyone get a bathroom break?"

I mean, i still like you, you look so badass and cool but... damn you are so changed... Do you sleep well? Do you need someone to talk to? I guess you were so alone since the separation from the group and from Pildu... Now you can talk to Dokja if you want."
79,"Dec 22, 2021","Sangah, Suyeong, Dokja and Jonghyuk are the reason why I'm bisexual/j"

79,"Dec 22, 2021","Oh no, she's HOT!"
79,"Dec 22, 2021",now this is starting to get interesting and she doesn't seem to want to tell anyone anything about her constellation 
79,"Dec 22, 2021","In my eyes, Sangah is still the same person except she has more guts to kill people without hesitation now. Also, what’s with the dark circles under her eyes? Did she not get any sleep or something?"
79,"Dec 22, 2021","Damn, dat hero landing from Sangah was lit!!! "
79,"Dec 22, 2021","She is pretty well equipped, alright 😏"
79,"Dec 22, 2021",I don't normally say this but I wish this gets an adaptation
79,"Dec 22, 2021","If Sangah's supporting constellation is not Ariadne, perhaps her ability is not the golden thread, but the mythic golden fleece. Perseus stole the golden fleece and was gifted the winged sandles of Hermes, enabling flight. Maybe weaving the golden fleece into a web is related to Perseus having the support and guidance of Athena, who is the Goddess of both battle strategy and weaving. It would explain how she vastly improved her fighting abilities. Her supporting constellation is Perseus."
79,"Dec 22, 2021",I hope we get a sneak peek at the other OG crew members 🤩
79,"Dec 22, 2021","I knew it. Sangah was there from the beginning, but has always been pretty invisible. However her being there since chapter 1 means she's a really important character and we just have to discover why"
79,"Dec 22, 2021",But like two amazingly beautiful strong woman fighting together side by side like how much better can it get. And our supposed mc in the back :/ loll

79,"Dec 22, 2021","daaayum, Sangah with that huge glow up tho, she's gonna be such a big asset to the team now. yeah, its a little unnerving that she went from caring about lives to her killing with no hesitation. 2 theories, either she realized that Dokja can't kill so she needs to step up and define who her enemies are, OR the rare items or whatever is messing with her in a way where her morals no longer mean anything. I'm kinda leaning toward the latter but I could be completely wrong"
79,"Dec 22, 2021",BLACK WIDOW?????
79,"Dec 22, 2021",Is kim dokja that weak that like every one can be stronger than him? 
79,"Dec 22, 2021",It's possible that Sangah was hiding her true personality upto this point. And if it's really that... then she's too scary. But if her personality changed this fast because she went through some crazy trauma... then she probably hasn't overcome that trauma yet. And it would be one really terrible trauma.
79,"Dec 22, 2021",Yessss she became so powerfullll (I really hope she doesn’t become a future enemy when they said to be wary of “her”

79,"Aug 9, 2022",this is why i stan women💅
79,"Aug 5, 2022",i think the reason why dokja hinders their growth is because they rely on him too much and expect him to solve everything for them so i think the separation was necessary for them to reach their full potential

That's why he's alone right now. I figured she got out and it obviously changed her. Same thing gonna happen to the bug kid I presume. I'd hoped she'd tell him a bit, but it's right back into the action I guess :) "
79,"Dec 22, 2021",I honestly completely forget about dokjas old teammates 
79,"Dec 22, 2021",I’ll be honest Sangah wasn’t my fav character but now I like her even less

79,"Dec 22, 2021",Damn look at you Sangah
79,"Dec 22, 2021",my guess is she did the same as dokja or whatever his name and formed an alliance with idk its name but the white floating thing 
79,"Dec 22, 2021",mommy? sorry. mommy? sorry. mommy? sorry
79,"Dec 22, 2021",Sangha really is suspicious.. i wonder who he meant to be careful .. 
79,"Dec 22, 2021","Han Sooyoung: Anything you say in the next thirty seconds is completely free, starting right now. //Yoo Sangah: I think you’re cocky. Arrogant. Bossy and pushy. You also have a god complex and don’t think of anybody but yourself. //

Yoo Sangah: Wait, I still have twenty-three seconds and I’m not done."

79,"Dec 22, 2021","On the one hand, I'l happy to see Sangah back and it seems that she will have way more screen time now... on the other hand ... what happened to her? Seeing her kill so many people was shocking, she also seems way more carefree and kind now. it isn't necessarily a bad thing in such a setting but I was rooting for her to still be able to be kind in that mess. Also, her dark circles are scaring me. "
79,"Dec 22, 2021",guys... I messed up... I spoiled it for myself and now I know how it's going go a bit.... it hit me like a fukinh truck.... I'm crying... punching God on the dik... yelling at the oceans... ripping my hair out... inverting my eyes.. edit: I hope u go through the same pains as me 😊✌
79,"Dec 22, 2021",Coins you will be remembered 
79,"Dec 22, 2021",I usted to trust sangah specially because she seemed to be the one who kept the moral compass but her secretive constellation contract and hidden character profile were always sus. I hope the rest of the gang still loyal tho </3 
79,"Dec 22, 2021",Sangah became so strong it's scary though

79,"Dec 22, 2021",This embodies I love my choppa perfectly 
79,"Dec 22, 2021","well when Sangah was turned into vp or whatever during the capture the flag event she did a sneaky smile soo... id trust her less,, the only reason why she hasnt done much i think is bc she feels something towards Dokja bc they experienced the first scenario together AND she hung out with Pildu too much imo so her mind is prob currupted in some way shape or form bc of that alone"
79,"Dec 22, 2021","Could it be Athena? It's possible that Athena is Sangah's supporting constellation. The Hermes' stroll and thread thing would make sense then. Plus Athena would value people like Sangah who pursue knowledge (she used to spend time learning languages before all this began). But if the constellation is Korean, then I have no clue who it could be."
79,"Dec 22, 2021","dokja said ""well equipped"" and looked directly at her boobies lol"
79,"Dec 22, 2021",We only saw his quest I wonder what their quest is… I bet one of them has a quest to hatch the catastrophe early.

79,"Dec 22, 2021",Poor Dokja still has no talent
79,"Dec 22, 2021","Ok, I know she’s Greek but maybe her constellation is arachne, unless anyone else knows about a thread based  deity in South Korean."

79,"Nov 18, 2021",I'm betting that her supporting constellation is arachne due to the spider webs and hermes scroll being a part of Greek mythology.

79,"Nov 17, 2021",Sangah seems to be hiding something because she insinuated Pilduh died even though he isn’t and how did she get so strong? Something is off and think someone might be impersonating her. 
79,"Nov 17, 2021",The fact that sangah can kill dozens of people at a time means she’s probably raking in huge sums of money and donations 💰💰💰

79,"Dec 22, 2021",I think that this Sangah isn’t the real Sangha and is actually the poison beauty because she is was too strong. But there a a lot of factors that go against this theory. And where tf is Gilyeong!

79,2 days ago,Ummm…… Sangah-nim … I’m in love with yo- I SWEAR I DIDN’T FORGET YOUR NAME UNTIL NOW!!!!!🥹Marry me please🧎🏾‍♀️
79,3 days ago,I'm really really curious about Sangha from the very beginning. The amount of transformation she has been through in just a few episodes is utterly terrifying. She trusted Dokja a lot. I hope that hasn't changed yet. Cuz i feel Sangha is no longer someone whom you should have on your bad side.

79,"Aug 8, 2022",So we have acknowledged Hermes…maybe it’s because I’m American and feel underrepresented for a change lol but it felt weird to bring up King Arthur as a way to appease white people but none of the Greek/Roman gods with all the talks of constellations when they’re literally some of the most common names of the stars in the western world- which is based a lot on the Roman Empire which took a lot of Greek myths. No one from the uk can look at the sky and find King Arthur but they can all find Orion

They all grew incredibly strong thanks to Dokja. Maybe Sangah and Hyeonseong we're too reliant on Dokja. They did lack confidence in their own ability and just needed that little push. He gave them all the necessary tools to survive. He shouldn't beat himself up too badly. It looks like Sangah has an SS tier ability that helped her."
79,"Apr 8, 2022","Well that was a lot more awkward than expected. I wonder why Sangah is so secretive about her power up. And yes Suyeong may have done some questionable things, she was genuinely trying to save the world. Wow Sangah got in upgrade in abilities, gear, and looks 😍😍 Too bad she's also more willing to kill. Must have had a lot happen to her. I wonder how the others are doing. "

79,"Feb 17, 2022","So I know I’m really late to the party, but what if this Sangha isn’t the same sangha we knew. It seems like she’s been through a lot in a very short amount of time, not enough time really. I wonder if she is a sangha from a different point in time. That would explain her rapid growth and skill accumulation while also giving context to her awkwardness with our protagonist. Maybe she thinks he abandoned them or forgot about his people because, to her, he’s been gon much longer. Probably wrong tho"

79,"Jan 16, 2022","It really is suspicious how Sungah improved so much alone. Also, back then she really valued human lives and didn't seem to like hurting others, but now she just dismembered all of those people like they were nothing, and doesn't seem regretfull at all"
