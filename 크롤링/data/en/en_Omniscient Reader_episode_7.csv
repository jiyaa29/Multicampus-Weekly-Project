Episode,Date,Review
7,"Aug 19, 2020",that was such a 1000 IQ moment
7,"Aug 19, 2020",this is slowly reminding me of solo leveling. IT'S GREAT!!!
7,"Aug 19, 2020",“exclusive edgelord skill - grimdark awakening” is killing me
7,"Aug 19, 2020","I don’t remember the MC’s name but I definitely am liking him a lot so far. He seems like a practical guy. He isn’t saving the granny to help her, he’s doing it to stop the guy. He didn’t care to even out the odds for the others and help them survive, instead he let them scavenge to fight for it themselves. All his actions thus far almost seem cruel but very critical actions. This isn’t the typical hero-type Protagonist and Im loving it. And of course he’s not bad either, since he helped the kid"
7,"Aug 27, 2020",Bacteria is technically a living organism. Imagine having hand sanitizer and breaking the game instantly. 
7,"Aug 26, 2020","The point of the mission was to ""Prove their Worth"". Simply being violent in the name of survival is hardly any appealing trait in any apparently sentient species. I think the ""constellations"" *wanted* them to think the quest through. If they had just realized that the kid's bugs counted as ""Living Organisms"", a large amount of them would've survived. Though because they resorted to useless violence immediately, they had shown how useless they were in the grand scheme of things"
7,"Sep 9, 2020","FINALLY, A MAIN CHARACTER WHO’S NOT INCREDIBLY STUPID."
7,"Aug 20, 2020",is this story secretly trying to tell us to read more...
7,"Sep 2, 2020","So, anyone know what happened to the girl?"
7,"Aug 28, 2020","But, he killed off a supporting character to the plot. Things are gonna get shaky... Unless he accident stepped on an egg or something? Or the grandma died at the last second "
7,"Sep 9, 2020","fun fact: like it was said at first ep dokja means reader and they literally used the word dokja as reader in korean title so its also ""omniscient dokja's viewpoint"" "
7,"Aug 21, 2020",from 'chuunibyou' and 'blackening' to 'edgelord' and 'grimdark awakening'—though it's still way better than the translation in webtoon indonesia...
7,"Aug 19, 2020",i won't survive in this apocalypse
7,"Sep 9, 2020",Dokja*says he doesn't want to change much of the story so it doesn't become unpredictable* also Dokja: *proceeds to kill one of the main characters because he dislikes him*
7,"Aug 19, 2020",HAHAAA UNO REVERSE PICK UP THE WHOLE FREAKIN DECK 
7,"Aug 26, 2020",its gonna be one of the best webtoon ever
7,"Aug 20, 2020",Ah yes you love to see the main character already killing over 100 living creatures in the first 6 episodes
7,"Aug 28, 2020","Wait, so he could've distributed those eggs to everyone in the cabin..."
7,"Sep 9, 2020","he does know that if the white haired guy dies, the chances of the storyline changing are completely possible right? 😶"
7,"Sep 9, 2020","Guys, we have a smart mc ☺️"
7,"Aug 20, 2020","My webtoon coin dealer be like, your back again, that’ll be 30 dollars for 300 more coins "
7,"Aug 19, 2020",This is why we must study even you hate it 😩
7,"Sep 9, 2020",Dokja has the opportunity to kill the character he hates in his favourite novel and he takes it lmaooo
7,"Aug 27, 2020","""If you listen to me this once, I promise i won't ever bother you again""... Proceads to let her die."
7,"Aug 20, 2020","Dokja: OH HO, SO YOU'RE APPROACHING ME?!"
7,"Aug 23, 2020",Hate to say that but I like that kid...
7,"Aug 19, 2020",Dokja has crushed the competition so well that they exploded
7,"Sep 9, 2020",People can use sanitizers and kill bacteria... That should count I think
7,"Aug 20, 2020",So. All my coins have lead me here. What now?
7,"Aug 24, 2020",so good 5 coins so worth it 
7,"Sep 9, 2020",i cant wait for dokja’s boyfriend to show up
7,"Sep 9, 2020",WE HAVE A MC WHO WOULD GET IN THE CAR INSTEAD OF RUNNING UPSTAIRS IF THEY WERE IN A HORROR MOVIE
7,"Sep 9, 2020","He's not naive hero-type, he's not trying to save everyone. He realises he cant."
7,"Sep 2, 2020",Did he forget about the coworker girl? She dead now.
7,"Sep 9, 2020",petition for this to be turned into anime❤️🤚🏻
7,"Sep 9, 2020",I just realized that the grandma still died 😶
7,"Sep 9, 2020",bro imagine we read this series and this is exactly how the world ends 😳 
7,"Aug 26, 2020","WAIT! WASN'T THE NUMBER OF SURVIVORS just 2 !?????! does it means Dojka is a new character here and coz of this change, many other things will also change?!! and what if one of the changes is that DOJKA BECOMES THE PROTAGONIST OF THE NOVEL AND NOT THE ONE HE READ IN THE NOVEL???!!!!! (technically he IS the protagonist, not in that TWSA but in webtoon 'OMNISCIENT READER')"
7,"Sep 11, 2020","To everyone who thinks this is very much like Solo Levelling I hope y’all are in for a ride because this webnovel is even crazier, aside from historical references it also has one of the best plotlines (imo) in the recent webnovels I have read."
7,"Sep 9, 2020","Outside of the obvious artstyle, MC design and the 'system'-like interface similarities can we... erm, you know, like, collectively see that this is nothing like Solo Leveling? I like SL as well so at first it was all fun and cool but at this point the lack of realization of some of yall is making me iffy. Sp we're talkin bout orv here. O R V. The novel of this is well written, endless list of important side characters, female badasses and its plot is detailed to its brim."
7,"Nov 9, 2020","For those who r saying ""he could give a bug egg to each person so everyone could survive"" well, even tho if all of them survive, yall see how useless they are. They were ganging up on an old person because a highschool kid encourage them to. Theyre going to die sooner rather than later and in surviving having too many people inside a group makes it hard to live. Like food management, etc. So with Dokja leaaving them to die i kinda agree with his choice. "
7,"Sep 10, 2020","I like how Dokja is a full adult, not some high schooler anymore.I guess many people don’t like the fact that Dokja didn’t try to save people as much as he could. I actually like that aspect of him. He’s not trying to be completely good or bad, he’s just a reasonable reader."
7,"Aug 19, 2020",I’m also an avid webnovel/webtoon reader. I’m only reading this for research for when I get transmigrated into this sh*t. It has nothing to do with the awesome story or art. 😂
7,"Sep 9, 2020",woah this comic can be a good anime series🧐🧐🧐🧐🧐
7,"Sep 9, 2020",Which student just carries around a knife in his pocket...
7,"Sep 9, 2020",this chapter is like when you're 13 and you write an au fanfic and you kill off the character you didn't like
7,"Sep 9, 2020","Man, I love those smart protagonist moments!"
7,"Sep 9, 2020",sooooo the old lady dies anyway because she didn't kill anything
7,"Aug 20, 2020","I've already blown through 15 coins, I wanna blow through 15 more "
7,"Sep 10, 2020",This is the kind of person I want to be. Hella smart hella dope. But hella nice. WHY CANT I LIVE IN ANIME/MANGA/MANWA/ETC
7,"Sep 10, 2020",Literally was thinking about this comic all of last night cuz it's so awesome then the next day it turned into the apocalypse where I live. (All the smoke California and Oregon fires West Coast USA gathered where I live making the sky so dark everyone had the lights on to see at noon)
7,"Sep 10, 2020",I thought he didn't want to change the story too much so he could still rely on the twsa manuscript. Killing one of the main characters in the early stages of the story is sure to have a huge influence in future events.
7,"Sep 10, 2020","yoo this dude is really smart, i on the other hand invested my 2700 coins on fast pass ;(("
7,"Sep 9, 2020",When you have a math online class but the comic of your fav Webnovel is just more important (I bet the teachers are gunna dislike)
7,"Sep 9, 2020","woooh dokja looked so badass when he said ""I am not gonna die.....u are"" awesome!!"
7,"Sep 9, 2020",I want anime version of this webtoon later ...........!!!! I t would be the master piece ... i m sure...!! THANK YOU SHINGSHONG for this webtoon ...!!! Love U ..!!!
7,"Sep 9, 2020","""If i hesitate i will die""*kills grasshopper babies*
*activates a new skill*
*Solo level badass looking*
"
7,"Sep 12, 2020","so, did the girl from his work survive or did he just leave her to die?"
7,"Sep 9, 2020","""would you like a tutorial on coin usage"" yes yeah thank you I'm fighting a edgelord I need this right now 😑"
7,"Sep 9, 2020",“YOU SLIMY JERK” - the slimy jerk
7,"Sep 12, 2020","ThisWEBTOON follows the light novel amazingly, I thought it was going to be a failure like the second coming of gluttony’s Manhwa that got butchered but no splendid job Webtoon"
7,"Sep 10, 2020",GUYS I AM DYIJG FROM EXCITEMENT THIS IS JUST DOPE I CANT GET THIS OUT OF MY HEAD IT'S THE BEST THE BEST THE BEST THE BEST THE BEST THE BEST THE BEST THE BEST THE BEST THE BEST THE BEST THE BEST THE BEST THE BEST THE BEST THE BEST THE BEST THE BEST THE BEST THE BEST THE BEST THE BEST THE BEST THE BEST THE BEST THE BEST THE BEST THE BEST THE BEST THE BEST THE BEST THE BEST THE BEST THE BEST THE BEST THE BEST THE BEST THE BEST THE BEST THE BEST THE BEST THE BEST THE BEST THE BEST THE BEST THE BEST 
7,"Sep 10, 2020",So we are forgetting about the girl
7,"Sep 10, 2020","Please change “Stamina” to “Physique”. Stamina doesn’t imply resilience. That said, I’m quite happy with this adaptation 😊"
7,"Sep 9, 2020","I predict that this webtoon will have 3,149 episodes😎"
7,"Sep 9, 2020",doesn't mean that the story will change?
7,"Sep 9, 2020",so its like work smart instead of work hard
7,"Sep 11, 2020","I would have died, I don't know my right to left"
7,"Sep 9, 2020","although i read the light novel, I'm just here to give heart and support the author. thank you for creating such a great story!"
7,"Sep 9, 2020",this why you pay attention in your biology class
7,"Sep 9, 2020",10/10 webtoon 
7,"Sep 9, 2020","People who keep saying that this is “Solo Leveling 2” “Solo Leveling copycat” or expecting that this is gonna be another SL in general will going to be Extremely Disappointed when ORV turns out to the total opposite. Jinwoo is OP, Dokja is intelligent; Jinwoo is a cold guy, Dokja is emotional and willing to sacrifice for his team; Jinwoo gets married in the end, Dokja doesn’t end up with anyone. Not to mention that this novel has a huge important female cast but there’s no romance or harem lol."
7,"Sep 9, 2020","So... is our protagonist going to take the web novel protagonist place or we'll have our protagonist and the ""protagonist""?"
7,"Sep 9, 2020","When I was reading the novel of this, I didn't expect the art to be this good. "
7,"Jul 13, 2021",Does no one feel bad for that old lady-?? >.>
7,"Feb 3, 2021",Does anyone else wonder what happened to the girl he was with.
7,"Sep 13, 2020","I’m glad you guys are finally reading this.
For the rest of us that’s been reading for awhile, who’s excited to finally see artwork added into this masterpiece 😍"
7,"Sep 12, 2020",Did he squish a pregnant grass hopper?
7,"Sep 11, 2020",see kids this is why you should listen in class it might potentally aid you in an apocaslyps
7,"Sep 11, 2020","This is everything I wanted, a main character that actually READS STUFF AND PAYS ATTENTION like he understands that he shouldn’t let the “Edge lord” (pfft best name) reach the next level because of how hard that would make it for HIM. "
7,"Sep 10, 2020","Not to be like that but i think that was a miss translation as stamina and endurance are different things and seeinf as he gets stabbes no damage taken, I'm pretty sure it is supposes to say endurance"
7,"Sep 9, 2020",this has the potential to be the greatest webtoon ever.
7,"Sep 9, 2020","swear if i hear anyone say it’s a copy or very similar to something else i’m going to be mad 😡😡😡, lol jk but still i find this to be a original piece and not really copied off some trend. "
7,"Sep 9, 2020",Poor baby was bullied for reading novels...😔
7,"Sep 9, 2020","""Prove your value"" ""survival of the fittest"" this webtoon is about an acolypse but it's too relatable with real life too☹️"
7,"Sep 9, 2020",Damn he knows how to plan
7,"Sep 9, 2020",That was so freaking bad**s
7,"Sep 9, 2020",congratulations you have the cheat manual
7,"Sep 20, 2021",if only we could get webtoon coins by squishing bugs
7,"Jun 10, 2021",I hope he gave the little boy who owns the insects one to kill 
7,"May 19, 2021",Imagine reading the last chapter of this webtoon and then all of it becomes real🤣🤣🤣
7,"Apr 27, 2021","""do eggs count as an organism? the answer is yes.""  female on their period sitting in the corner chilling- ""Way ahead of you m8"""
7,"Apr 27, 2021",What about the girl? Did she kill anything?
7,"Feb 27, 2021",Have we forgotten bout the girl? XDD
7,"Feb 25, 2021",i can imagine the dude with white hair in bakugos voice
7,"Feb 24, 2021",Omniscient means knowing everything 
7,"Sep 17, 2020",This...will probably be a well known WEBTOON like. 2 yrs from now?
7,"Sep 14, 2020",Dokja out there practically turning the novel to a fanfic bc he does things different from the novel 😅
7,"Sep 10, 2020",Should have crushed his balls for more coins 😤
7,"Sep 10, 2020",this as an ANIME doe!!! dont get me started. it would be sick. the art and plot are seriously perfect for it. not to mention the characters are hella fine...
7,"Sep 10, 2020",plot twist this entire webtoon is to promote using hand sanitizer
7,"Sep 10, 2020",My guy IQ is over 90 thousand
7,"Sep 9, 2020","when he used 2700 coins to raise stamina, i just hit heart coz that is one Great move! wow! see, who says reading a manga or webtoons for years doesnt pay off. lol. 😜😅 "

7,"Sep 9, 2020",but what happened to that girl?
7,"Sep 9, 2020",Namwon needs to eat a Snickers
7,"Sep 9, 2020","Dude that was so awesome he used big eggs to gain a bunch of coins then used it to level up his stamina and dexterity he is a coolheaded genius
And the way he looked at the end was something on par with the best scenes like that"
7,"Sep 9, 2020",Ugh I discovered this webtoon a little over a week ago... the novel is so good. I'm 5 chapters from the end of the novel and I dont want it to end 😩
7,"Sep 9, 2020",i almost forgot how bloody this story was
7,"Sep 9, 2020",When you have a math online class but the comic of your fav Webnovel is just more important (I bet the teachers are gunna dislike)
7,"Sep 9, 2020","wait, what about the girl he was with?"
7,"Sep 9, 2020",Everyone loves that sweet anime comic action fight😌👌

7,"Sep 2, 2021",This protagonist is so intelligent. Brainy af. 
7,"Jul 30, 2021","If you use hand sanitizer, wouldn't you kill millions of living organisms?"
7,"Jul 8, 2021",So people are just going to ignore the fact the the shangah lady might have died as well?
7,"Jun 17, 2021",No one hand any hand sanitizer? A small handheld bottle and no one would have had to die.
7,"May 1, 2021",He has the eggs.. Why didnt he give it away? And the granny he's defending hasnt killed anyone so she's gonna die in the end.. Im confused
7,"Apr 30, 2021",Wow I only started reading this for the free coins but now I'm actually invested
7,"Apr 27, 2021",Soo... if any of them had hand sanitizer they would've survived. Bacteria is an living organism. 
7,"Apr 26, 2021",w-wait! IS THAT BAKUGO'S SECRET LOVE CHILD!?!!
7,"Feb 24, 2021",Is anyone reading this in 2021?

7,"Oct 19, 2020","That big brain tho, I bet he would be fun to play among us"
7,"Oct 1, 2020","Oh, I was picturing this more as a story where he survives because he knows exactly what’s going to happen. But no, he can actually change the outcome. That makes this so much more interesting. "
7,"Sep 17, 2020",bruh this is why reading novels are important
7,"Sep 14, 2020",read the web novel its rlly good not gna spoil but super excited to see how the webtoon will turn out!!
7,"Sep 14, 2020","I wonder when ppl stop comparing this to sl? Like the plot is completely different, where is even a similarities? (don't mention art). Those who came here, bcs of sl and think that Dokja will be like Jinwoo, can stop right here and go back to sl. Dokja's power are brain, information and his strategies, and he is doing very good job in this. He will NEVER be the strongest and kicking asses here and there. There will be always someone who is stronger and have more influence. "
7,"Sep 12, 2020",I wonder who the 5 people are...
7,"Sep 11, 2020",[Some constellations are enjoying the story.]

7,"Sep 10, 2020",Big Brain Dokja
7,"Sep 10, 2020",Man I loved reading the novel. It does get a bit awkward in later parts but I can't wait to see it. I imagine it'll take a couple years to reach the end though at this pace.
7,"Sep 10, 2020","And he changed the story. More than two survived that cabin because of him, and the psychopath died."
7,"Sep 10, 2020",His IQ is dummy high of 169
7,"Sep 10, 2020",But...the girl? 
7,"Sep 10, 2020",BIG BRAIN TIME
7,"Sep 10, 2020",I do hope that Sanga made it
7,"Sep 10, 2020",Is it just me or does the dude with white hair act exactly like katsuki bakugo from my hero academia 
7,"Sep 10, 2020",no cap this comic is amazing
7,"Sep 10, 2020",That’s one badass dude!!

7,"Sep 9, 2020",I may have to kill some insects to get coins too if I want to get rid of these cliffhangers
7,"Sep 9, 2020",This should totally become an anime:)
7,"Sep 9, 2020",Since I've already read the novel I feel like Dokja : a reader who knows what will happen!!😊😊
7,"Sep 9, 2020",imagine getting rid of your least favorite character hell yeah!
7,"Sep 9, 2020",Can someone actually make a mobile game from this? Like maybe an RPG book or something like that..
7,"Sep 9, 2020","That was really smart. For a second there, I thought he was gonna kill the grandma so white hair couldn’t "
7,"Sep 9, 2020",this would be such an amazing anime omfg 😳
7,"Sep 9, 2020","First 'Edgelord' and then 'darkgrim awakening' ... I feel like the author just broke free from mortal constraints of chuniis ... Seriously, this is chunii in a whole new level...(not that im complaining)"
7,"Sep 9, 2020",I'm wondering where's the girl HAHAHHA
7,"Sep 9, 2020",i hate being broke. I wanna read so much more. this power system just boosted my interest in this series to a whole new lvl

7,"Sep 9, 2020",what about the girl?
7,"Sep 9, 2020",technically bacteria are also organisms so all they really needed was a bottle of hand sanitizer 
7,"Sep 9, 2020",I can't believe he actually died! But if he was part of the main story how is this going to change everything he already knows? why was he so desperate to get rid of him if it risked all the knowledge he had? I wonder how far the actual story went and how it ended... what's that girl doing currently?
7,"Sep 9, 2020",Is the girl who speaks Spanish alive
7,"Sep 9, 2020",I'm still waiting for my full appearance.

7,"Aug 20, 2020",Love the way Dokja is just being a boss receiving the blows like that 😂
7,"Jan 28, 2022",LOL MC is a psychopath himself.  Could've saved literally everyone in the cabin but decided he would rather level up faster.
7,"Jan 10, 2022","To be honest, bacteria counts as a living organism, right? If anyone had a bottle of hand sanitizer, everyone passes lol."
7,"Aug 16, 2021",everyone admiring his smartness but ig i'm the only one worried about that girl and the child😭😭

7,"Sep 9, 2020","I hope Sanga is still alive...in fact I think it would be cool if the five survivors from the cabin form a team as they advance through the story. I wish Sanga would be alive and join his team, and they can all learn to fight and defend themselves, all the while improving their levels and skill attributes as well. Other than that this story is going really good so far!"

7,"Sep 9, 2020",Did he forget about the girl or what?
7,"Sep 9, 2020","I guess he forgot about his gal pal. he gave one to the boy, but didn't give one to his co worker? I'm sure she figured it out "

7,"Jun 1, 2021",Doesnt he realise that he let the old women suffer
7,"May 28, 2021",this mc is so cool omg
7,"May 21, 2021","But wait, what if the granny died before the timer? She got stomped, punched and slapped to infinity. It wouldn't surprise me if she just died without the MC knowing"

7,"Apr 26, 2021","How could there be five of them when he killed another bug?? He killed a bug, He gave one to Gilyoung the boy who had the insects and three left. He killed one other bug, Two bugs left, Sangah, The military guy and Han are alive (so which one of these three__maybe__killed a person???)"
7,"Apr 26, 2021","Well, if killing any living organism is ok, then they should start washing or sanitizing their hands, It will kill a lot of micro organism."

7,"Sep 10, 2020","Is no one going to ask why he didn't share some eggs so more people could survive? There was less than one hundred people on that car, he would have had plenty to level up himself so that he could still face edgelord head on without just killing off all the weak people. "
7,"Sep 10, 2020",he jus let that girl croak didnt he ooof
7,"Sep 10, 2020",If cell is a living organism they can just bleed themselves a bit and let the cel die

7,"Sep 10, 2020","Ok but, did the lady survive 🗿"
7,"Sep 10, 2020",what a genius lol
7,"Sep 10, 2020",The sad part is if he felt inclined he could have given an egg to each person and they all could have survived but oh well 
7,"Sep 10, 2020",wait but if namwoon didn't survive doesnt that mean the whole plot will change and he won't know what happens anymore ?!
7,"Sep 10, 2020",Exceuse me?! what happened to the girl???

7,"Sep 9, 2020","Well, what can I say? ....it's feels good to be smart"
7,"Sep 9, 2020",Solo levelling vibe
7,"Sep 9, 2020",what about granny and the girl?
7,"Sep 9, 2020",I felt like it was useless to protect the granny.. She died anyway didn't she ? He could have just killed the psycho later and take that time to save his friend (forgot her name)

7,"Sep 9, 2020","But if the edgelord die, isn’t that a little too easy? The story made it sound like the edgelord is a lead too, maybe a villain? So does that mean he will be one of the survivors? Oh please let the girl survive please pleaseeee 😭"

7,"Sep 9, 2020",Read the novel because the wait for this is too hard. It's truly great and engrossing so you won't regret it at all. 
7,"Sep 9, 2020",edge Lord more like cringe lord
7,"Sep 9, 2020","But....I mean...ALL 2700? I would’ve saved at least like ten, I mean he still would’ve survived just fine if it was a bit off "

7,"Sep 9, 2020",wait does this mean this comic is going to be longer than 2000 episodes
7,"Sep 4, 2020",First time using coins and I’m still super late.. *visible disappointment* 
7,"Sep 4, 2020","Also, his duality snaps hard, man."

7,"Sep 2, 2020",did the girl he was with caught a bug???? please tell me she did!!!
7,"Aug 27, 2020",He look so badass at the end! Rock his shit bro!
7,"Aug 27, 2020","So he spent the entire time protecting the granny from getting killed by that guy, however, she is probably going to die now anyways because she didn’t kill anything. He could have distributed those eggs out, but instead he used them all on himself. It seems like he doesn’t care about anyone else surviving, he just wanted that guy to die."
7,"Aug 27, 2020",Sad thing though is I’m out of coins (dies in mock terror)
7,"Aug 26, 2020",this webtoon can be good anime .
7,"Aug 26, 2020","oh mc is brutal, I like it😘"
7,"Aug 25, 2020",That was badass af
7,"Aug 24, 2020",the MC here and the MC in the TWTS is so hotttttt 😍😍😍
7,"Aug 20, 2020",I see you YJH 👀
7,"Aug 20, 2020",WHAT ABOUT SANGA
7,"Aug 19, 2020",Those eyes in “You are “ are chilling and I’m here for it ❄️
7,"Jun 3, 2021","So instead of saving another person, he used the insect to level upmaybe he could have used the eggs to save the whole cabin 
But he decided to murder a person, not like the others to survive but with the intetent for killing him 
Old Lady should be dead too, he didn't saved her"
7,"Apr 27, 2021",yo why he so hot 
7,"Oct 28, 2020",its 10 thousand times better than solo leveling though
7,"Sep 13, 2020","see you later at hell while you are building gundam, kim namwoon"
7,"Sep 10, 2020",Wait don’t bacteria count as a living organism? So if you just wash your hands or just wash anything you could get thousands of points because of how dirty things are. Idk just saying
7,"Sep 9, 2020",is any one else wondering what happened to the girl this man's was with 
7,"Sep 9, 2020",but if he changes the story too much then he will lose his advantage 
7,"Sep 9, 2020","And just like that, edgelord 2.0 was born. lmao. "
7,"Sep 15, 2022",so whos the second person to live? nobody?
7,"Aug 19, 2022",I'm admittedly annoyed that he didn't give her a bug. 
7,"Aug 17, 2022",Damn he could have saved everone and just chose not to. So he could kill a character he doesnt like
7,"Aug 6, 2022",Smert.
7,"Aug 4, 2022",10:08 59% 10:09
7,"Aug 3, 2022",so he let the girl die?
7,"Jul 21, 2022","is it bad I so badly want the mc to turn morally  gray, like I want him to get his hands dirty and actively kill people later on down the story. I just think the story is more interesting if the mc is a villian like"
7,"Jul 12, 2022",So he could have saved everyone in the cabin with those eggs....huh
7,"Jul 12, 2022","Aaah yess i see metal gear meme. Namwoon: WHY WONT YOU DÍE!?, (Dokja: STAMINA SON!!) 😎"
7,"Jun 18, 2022",some persons in cabin killed one living organism. but sangha didn't kill any how will she survive? and the scenario also has end 😟
7,"Jun 16, 2022",Did he just protagonist? 
7,"Jun 15, 2022","ngl i wanted the ""edgelord"" to live"
7,"May 30, 2022","Everything couldve been avoided if they just line the females up and kill lices on their hair lmao, but realistically we kill microscopic organisms by just moving "
7,"May 29, 2022",clearly these guys are pro life lmao
7,"May 28, 2022",why didn't he just kill the old lady? then the psycho wouldn't be able to get a kill. I get it's not an easy thing to do but she was in a lot of pain and would have died anyway because she didn't get a kill
7,"May 28, 2022",and this is why i think studying helps you survive a potential apocolypse =)
7,"May 23, 2022",he forgot to give insect to girl? she died?
7,"May 19, 2022",this reminds me of mix between the gamer and zero game
7,"May 18, 2022",What about Sangah though?
7,"May 14, 2022","""Kill one or more living organisms"" *asks to borrow hand sanitizer to kill 99.99% of germs* 
boom-shaka-laka"
7,"May 11, 2022","If the requirement to survive is to kill another living being, in theory would killing yourself in that situation revive you afterwards?"
7,"May 7, 2022",I feel like I'm being trained for an apocalypse at this point-
7,"May 7, 2022","Alright I'm taking notes here...Tip 1- when assigned to kill as many organisms as possible, consider these possibilities-
1-If only humans are permitted,kill a woman who is expecting to get a double kill.
2-kill harmless beings,as well as animals who are expecting and/or have eggs.
"
7,"Apr 28, 2022",am I the only one who's reading namwoon Kim's voice as Bakugo's 😂😂😂
7,"Apr 23, 2022",this webtoon has a lot ( like a lot) in common with The Gamer. very very good. gradually loving this comic and the amazing art

7,"Apr 4, 2022",sooo what happened to the girl?
7,"Apr 2, 2022","Did you know that sperms are living organisms. if you kick a man's balls it'll give millions upons millions points am i right?, right?"

7,"Feb 27, 2022",I thank you  pregnant Grasshopper for your sacrifice.

7,"Feb 13, 2022",damn
7,"Feb 13, 2022",Dokja my dude... that's cold. 
7,"Feb 9, 2022","WAAAITTTTT I NEED TO SEE THE WOMAN I THINK SANGHA WAS HER NAME, IS SHE ALIVEE"
7,"Feb 7, 2022",HE'S SO COOL
7,"Feb 4, 2022",what? his stamina increase not durability
7,"Feb 2, 2022",How many eggs do grasshoppers lay? A single female may lay as many as 300 eggs in a season. 
7,"Jan 31, 2022","That was such a smart move, the mc is getting cooler and cooler. "
7,"Jan 30, 2022",daaamn hes smart
7,"Jan 27, 2022",first time I thought webtoon.readers were OP
7,"Jan 23, 2022",who was shown stepping out in the starting? they showed the shoes only? is it someone in 3807? can someone help please
7,"Jan 22, 2022",So is Sangha dead?
7,"Jan 21, 2022",now the plot of the story is going to change since he changed the future of the novel. since he has these powers maybe he will overcome everything ig.
7,"Jan 20, 2022",Wait..he’s not going to save his coworker? What’s her name again? SangAh??
7,"Jan 17, 2022",Stuff like this makes me see my ADD brain as a power. The amount of useless information could safe my life one day. lol.I'm loving this so much and the art is Top Tier!
7,"Jan 9, 2022",This Webtoon is The Best example of 'Knowledge is Power'.
7,"Jan 7, 2022",if someone had hand sanitizer or rubbing alcohol there's probably billions of bacteria in that subway let alone on their hands
7,"Jan 4, 2022",I comic is amazing I try to read another comics on this app but for somereason I get a little bored but this is the first comic that I enjoy. I hope we will get to read more of your works in the future
7,"Dec 31, 2021","He forgot about his friend, I think she died"
7,"Dec 29, 2021",nice im also learning about grasshoppers 
7,"Dec 28, 2021","i thought there were three bugs left? kim had already killed one, releasing the other three. so if we assume every bug was squished by separate people, that SHOULD make 4 people total having survived. however, we see kim find another bug and kill it, the eggs within included. so there should be 3 people who survived, at max. did the other two survivors accidently crush an insect egg underfoot, or did they kill another human before the revelation of exactly how far ""living organism"" extends?"
7,"Dec 24, 2021",Really reminds me of a series called The Gamer
7,"Dec 22, 2021",*edgelord intensifies*

7,"Apr 28, 2021",i'm on my third reread of the webtoon and i just realized that kim namwoon is wearing socks and slides???? in the panel where he aims for KDJ's heart. i don't know why i find that so funny 😂
7,"Apr 28, 2021",We no else came for the free coins but is actually so invested 
7,"Apr 27, 2021",ayo wheres the bangs girl
7,"Apr 27, 2021",Honestly this is amazing! It's so well written and illustrated it's like seeing a movie. I'm really enjoying this I'm so glad webtoon suggested this one!
7,"Apr 27, 2021",Bruh namwoon is a psycho version of kaidou lmao jet black wings 😩✊
7,"Apr 27, 2021",anyone else used too much of their data to read this? no? just me?

7,"Apr 26, 2021",i am so liking this!
7,"Apr 26, 2021",Gosh I forgot what a badass Dokja’s been this whole time! So awesome to see him completely shut him down
7,"Apr 26, 2021",Did the lady die? 
7,"Apr 26, 2021",""" oh-oh running out of breath but i uh-oh i got stamina"""
7,"Apr 26, 2021","I really hope his coworker survived, the one that was sitting next to him."
7,"Apr 26, 2021",well. i already thought he was going to kill some insects. they literally said to kill a living organism. i thought there would be some mosquito or something 😂😂😂
7,"Apr 26, 2021",OMG can't stop reading!!! I absolutely love this story and I'm only this far!!! Can't wait to see what happens next☺️☺️☺️
7,"Apr 26, 2021",Bro I'm surprised that Edgelord tried to kill him that entire time and didn't move to a different victim.
7,"Apr 26, 2021",He could have saved that entire cabin but he sacrificed them to level up because he hated one (1) character 
7,"Apr 26, 2021",IQ 999999
7,"Apr 26, 2021",not me imagining myself in this kind of situation...
7,"Apr 23, 2021",Iq lvl 99 :p
7,"Apr 13, 2021",OOF ngl that was such a badass move! 
7,"Apr 10, 2021",y'all don't have sanitizer? i mean like u can kill germs with it.....

7,"Mar 28, 2021",His IQ went 📈📈📈

7,"Mar 10, 2021",yes Namwoon didnt succeed. that is great indeed
7,"Mar 7, 2021",This is so satisfying… (◍•ᴗ•◍)❤uwu
7,"Mar 5, 2021",so basically he has an even more op version of the shanringan just without the extra abilities like Amaterasu and susanoo
7,"Mar 3, 2021",100 iq outplay
7,"Feb 25, 2021",stamina? it should be health right? or defense? cuz stamina is like your breath on how long you can last
7,"Feb 24, 2021",COOL DOOD
7,"Feb 18, 2021",sperm is living organism right?imagine fapping. u already killed millions. 😂
7,"Feb 18, 2021",DID THE KID LIVE THOU- LIKE THE KID WAS THE ONE WITH THE INSECTS
7,"Feb 11, 2021",dude just cheated the system. I love the RPG type leveling glitch by farming small enemies. in his case he technically killed 100s of living organisms meaning he is set for new upgrades
7,"Feb 10, 2021",Yeah you're right it kinda like have that solo leveling vibe
7,"Feb 7, 2021",increased stamina shouldn't increase your defense no matter how you look at it. 
7,"Feb 7, 2021",Big brain
7,"Jan 28, 2021","Wait, did the heroine die?"
7,"Jan 27, 2021",what happend to people that weren't on the subway 
7,"Jan 26, 2021",Love this genre! Can anyone recommend novels/manga/webtoons similar to this that are good? 
7,"Jan 22, 2021",I wish I had super power...
7,"Jan 21, 2021",Reminds me of Dice when he invested those coins into Stamina
7,"Jan 20, 2021","Yup, gaming system often provides convenient abilities so cheaply."
7,"Jan 19, 2021",19 yrs old Kim Namwoon has the same build and height as a 28 yrs old Kim Dokja... am I reading too much into this or does Dokja seem like he's maturing late?
7,"Jan 17, 2021",this is really addictive ....start to save money... because you'll HV to spend them later on this 
7,"Jan 16, 2021",what about that girl??? 
7,"Jan 14, 2021","Kind of reminding me of ""dice* with the skillset and all...  also the art 🔥🔥😩"
7,"Jan 14, 2021",OKAY I'M HOOKED

7,"Dec 2, 2020",Simping for you bro✌️
7,"Nov 29, 2020",I skipped sleep for this
7,"Nov 28, 2020",this shows that being an edgelord has its perks aside from just being embarrassing
7,"Nov 28, 2020",Now... I learned my lesson.. never skip Science class...
7,"Nov 10, 2020",What happened to the girl?
7,"Nov 3, 2020",what a genius.....a kill gives u 100 points so just smash 1000+ eggs 😃
7,"Oct 29, 2020",uhhhh im confused did i miss something how did stamina effect his durability.
7,"Oct 29, 2020",If I were in this i would have killed a bug already and just started randomly drinking human blood...... Yeah I guess I am blood thirsty....
7,"Oct 26, 2020",OMYGHAD HE'S SO SMART WTF
7,"Oct 26, 2020",My nerdy self is very satisfied with the fact usage pertaining to insects
7,"Oct 25, 2020",ultrainstinct.exe has been activated 
7,"Oct 25, 2020",It's a shame they didn't show Kim Namwoon begging for his life. Edit: Nevermind.

7,"Oct 18, 2020",dont forget to like the episode guys!! have a nice day :)
7,"Oct 17, 2020",For some reason the song System from Queen of the Damned came to mind 
7,"Oct 16, 2020","But.... he just forgot about his colleague? Btw I hope the kid survived, even if it’s unlikely... "
7,"Oct 16, 2020",Sht ik kdj is hella awesome but im still wheezing at edgelord ok

7,"Oct 16, 2020",but... sanga?
7,"Oct 16, 2020",My thing is why didn’t he throw the knife at someone else tho🤦🏾‍♀️🤔
7,"Oct 16, 2020","this reminds me of how I used to farm rare low lvl mobs for exp and coins and then buy op gear and reck high level (20+) bosses as a lvl 5. ah, good times good times. that or exploiting redoable quests that give a lot of coin."
7,"Oct 16, 2020","Can I ask a stupid question? Are germs considered living organisms? Pardon my stupidity, anyway if they are then hand sanitizer or soap."
7,"Oct 16, 2020",DAMN. THIS IS SOOOO GOOD!! It's still the first early chapters but it's already making me crave for more!! I am so excited to continue and read this comic!

7,"Oct 15, 2020",wow so there's something different again (number of survivors increased) 
7,"Oct 15, 2020",he's basically like bakugou but so much more unlikeable

7,"Sep 26, 2020",BigBrain moments at the end. BTW...Edgelord 😏🤣
7,"Sep 25, 2020",There was only 2 original survivors so if there’s 5 does that mean he broke the book?
7,"Sep 23, 2020",What will happen now to the story? one of the character of TWSA died 🤔
7,"Sep 20, 2020","first he wanted to save old lady . encounters namwoon Kim. refuses to partner with him. activates his skill. doges attack not enough so kill another organism gains bonus points and using this he prolongs his time ! clever👏

7,"Sep 16, 2020",Aww~ I kinda wanted the Lunatic to survive
7,"Sep 16, 2020",Well that's very useful...knowing where the attacks are coming and knowing how to invest your coins without a time consuming tutorial. But he's gonna be on high alert with the constellation people because he's so awesome
7,"Sep 16, 2020",The elementary schoolers sharing their scented sparkle hand sanitizers when this happened all immediately pass and start getting crazy leveled up bc of all the germs they killed
7,"Sep 16, 2020",the white haired dude gives me highkey accelerator vibes and i wish for them to team up and to become best bros but thats so not gonna happen

7,"Sep 14, 2020",he had all those eggs and now the entire cabin dies
7,"Sep 13, 2020","another way he could've done the task was to wipe his hands on a few surfaces, and than taken out hand sanitizer - it kills 99.9% of all germs, which are alive. probably the grandma would've had some"
7,"Sep 13, 2020","at the end, the granny hasn't killed any living organism and died. "
7,"Sep 13, 2020",so what happened to the old lady? did she die too because she couldn't fulfill the mission?

7,"Sep 9, 2020","Damn, I'm just waiting for Yoo to show himsepf"
7,"Sep 9, 2020","Dude, he indirectly killed someone by killing another bug and making it unavailable for killing purposes. The suspense is *killing* me!! Also, how did he know that bug had eggs during the heat of the moment?"
7,"Sep 9, 2020","Ok, Dokja made sure that Namwoon guy would die because he was such a nefarious character in the light novel, but removing him from the story so early on should cause a huge butterfly effect and change the unfolding of events! How much of a disadvantage will this bring to our hero? Also, Pregnant Bug Ex Machina, activate!!!!!"
7,"Sep 9, 2020","Man, this is quite frustrating, they should upload every 2 days!!!! "

7,"Sep 9, 2020","I got chills, seriously, no kidding. "
7,"Sep 9, 2020",that was hot 
7,"Sep 9, 2020",I love this scene so much. Our edgelord being an edgelord and our reader being a badass just... muah~ I also can't wait to see our protag come in.
7,"Sep 9, 2020","A split personality? Why did white hair assume that MC has split personality? I don't get it, lol? 🤨😂"
7,"Sep 9, 2020",I'm in love with this
7,"Sep 9, 2020",so what will happen now I mean he changed a major point in the story so is his reading ability useless?
7,"Sep 9, 2020",gore yes please
7,"Sep 9, 2020",This kinda reminds me of The Gamer webtoon
7,"Sep 9, 2020",I enjoying this fight:3
7,"Sep 9, 2020",The story reminds me of Solo Levelling
7,"Sep 9, 2020",I realize this is a serious story but I couldn't help laughing when he got his second skill and kept doing Nawoon. I have a feeling Dokja is supposed to be the protagonist of this story. I also love how his skills relate to the TWSA. I guess it gave him an edge. I loved when he leveled up and outsmarted Namjoon. I do wonder who survived though 
7,"Sep 9, 2020",5 survived?  mc and three insects who killed someone
7,"Sep 9, 2020","After reading the LN, I now have Omniscient Reader Skill level 1. You're in for a riiiiiide!!!"
7,"Sep 9, 2020",Namwoon kim reminds me of kaido from disastrous life of saiki k.
7,"Sep 9, 2020",I wonder if he's planning to take his spot in the story
7,"Sep 9, 2020","""Why won't you die?"" ""Nanomachine, son"""
7,"Sep 9, 2020",Okay but what about the woman from his work?? Was it Sanga? I thought he would have given her one!!
7,"Sep 9, 2020",I wish this was a real game I would so play it
7,"Sep 9, 2020","Only 2 people survived in that subway cabin in TWASA (Chapter 4), but it became 5 people... I wonder how - or if - that changes the story."
7,"Sep 9, 2020",that investment in stamina gave me major the gamer vibes like how he invests all his points for mana
7,"Sep 9, 2020",wait... is that overachievering girl alive???
7,"Sep 9, 2020",Am about to pass out from edgelord and grimdark awakening
7,"Sep 9, 2020",Hope Grandma lives and the girl
7,"Sep 9, 2020",it’s all fun and games until he finds someone whose aim is so bad that they end up hitting a totally different area than they planned on
7,"Sep 9, 2020","dang are ppl actually reading this here and paying for chapters? you can go to other places and even the translators website if u want which is already at chapter 20, updates frequently, and is free."
7,"Sep 9, 2020",Big brain boy
7,"Sep 9, 2020",WHAT ABOUT THE GIRLLL...DID SHE SQUISH A BUG ALSO!?!?!
7,"Sep 9, 2020",Couldn’t he have. I don’t know. Given those eggs to the people on the train?
7,"Sep 9, 2020","wait, so did the chick survive?"
7,"Sep 9, 2020",So now our protagonist (the protagonist of the Webnovel we’re reading where he’s NOT the protagonist of the webnovel that he read) now has rock hard abs! XD. I kinda wished that the knife would have actually broken on his abs. That would have been both unnecessary but also awesome!
7,"Sep 9, 2020",I would have washed my hand with sanitaizar or hand wash.
7,"Sep 9, 2020",who are the 5 survivors??i wanna know so bad 
7,"Sep 9, 2020",so does that HR lady he likes survive? if so I'm really shipping them together big time.
7,"Sep 9, 2020","oof, that was wild! "
7,"Sep 9, 2020",I wonder he will a solo player or a solo survivor like kirito.
7,"Sep 9, 2020",this is sooo good.
7,"Sep 9, 2020",Take my money 
7,"Sep 9, 2020",what happened to that girl thennnn

7,"Sep 9, 2020",Wait! Are we going to ignore all the other people dying in the background?
7,"Sep 9, 2020","but did the chick and the kid survive? also the whole attribute, leveling, and system talking to you thing reminds me of HCLW"
7,"Sep 9, 2020",5head moment go brrrr
7,"Sep 9, 2020",189 dumb high IQ 
7,"Sep 9, 2020",Solo Leveling Vibes. This is going to be great 😍
7,"Sep 9, 2020",Wow imagine having the title of the webtoon as your username ptooo ptooo CRINGE
7,"Sep 9, 2020","Damn, the dream of the real world, if anyone gets my reference. minecraft...green and white...no?"
7,"Sep 9, 2020",Big Brain moves
7,"Sep 9, 2020",Our main character is slowly evolving to that Emo edgelord
7,"Sep 9, 2020",when the plot armer just straight up tell the mc what's going to happen
7,"Sep 9, 2020","Him: “it’s you who’s going to die”

The white guy: 👁00👁"
7,"Sep 9, 2020","I love smart comics, webtoons and manga. Something that keeps the thinking going. this Webtoon will literally be 200IQ every episode "
7,"Sep 9, 2020","Wow, I didn't see that coming! "
7,"Sep 9, 2020",I would not survive in that senario cause I would not have thought that quickly.

7,"Sep 9, 2020","Ok, am I the only one who  like/liked Namwoon Kim?  Sure, he's a brat, but I kinda like those type of characters that are a little coo-coo in the head if you know what I mean"
7,"Sep 9, 2020",Ahhhh. The uncanny solo leveling vibes. 
7,"Sep 9, 2020","what would've happened if he bust out some lysol, coughed and proceeded to kill the bacterial organisms?"
7,"Sep 9, 2020",Grimdark awakening sounds like some edgy high school band. I love it 😂
7,"Sep 9, 2020",I love this. 
7,"Sep 9, 2020",if you like this try reading Solo Leveling. its the same creator 
7,"Sep 9, 2020",What happened to the girl?!
7,"Sep 9, 2020",dang he smart as heck no matter what
7,"Sep 9, 2020","he's not the type to worry about friendship yet. He's more like surviving and thinking that this or that guy will be useful. He's the protagonist but at the same time a reader, he keeps insisting he's just a reader. He doesn't know that later on he will be the main character."
7,"Sep 9, 2020",wasaaap notif ganggg
7,"Sep 9, 2020",Oml this story is so cool 😍

7,"Sep 9, 2020",I don't get it. How does the psychopath have that skill? The protagonist didn't even get an option for it. 
7,"Sep 9, 2020",The MC has got epitaph lol. The only thing remaining is to shout KING CRIMSON
7,"Sep 9, 2020","The granny also died though? Because she didn't have the time to kill a insect or something I guess, so ..."

7,"Sep 9, 2020","How tf does he remember everything about that book, I can't remember half about other things such as giving food to my dog in the morning"
7,"Sep 9, 2020",see this is why I should study and pay attention in class

7,"Aug 18, 2022",is killing a germ killing a living organism? *proceeds to take out hand sanitier*
7,"Aug 15, 2022","to those who are new to this webtoon (myself included): there are 5 survivors in the first scenario. my guesses are: dokja, the insect boy, sangah, lee hyeonseong?, and another person on the cabin. or sangah might die and another stranger will survive instead. also, notice that our supporting character will most likely die. this could change the way the real story goes significantly."
7,"Aug 8, 2022",so is taking one of the novel character's place.

7,"Jun 5, 2022",How much is the book really going to help him now that he's altered the way things happened so much?
7,"Jun 3, 2022","so, I get that he needed the power boost to survive, but if insect eggs count, that means that theoretically all the passengers could have survived."
7,"Jun 1, 2022",wasn't that pointless af? the old lady is gonna die since she didn't kill anything 
7,"May 31, 2022",smoking that Snowflake pack 🚬

Also if he had not played judge and jury with the guy who turned psycho, maybe there would be a chance to change his outcome."
7,"Mar 8, 2022",Nice
7,"Mar 6, 2022","noo, why did he have to die😭😭😭"
7,"Mar 5, 2022",Damn he really did all that because he didn't like his character. I'm really glad that he's not the protagonist tho or it would've been to easy for him.
7,"Mar 4, 2022",ok but the insect egg part EW

7,"Apr 7, 2021","honestly this story is so well thought out. it's so naturally unique and easily comprehensible. like the way that he's the reader and his abilities are related to that makes for the absolute perfect perspective for this story. with his attribute as the reader, we can easily know more about the context of the situation without any half-assed ""the mc automatically knows, can explain, and can predict everything"" logic.

7,"Mar 27, 2021",my man unlocked the reading version of sharingan

7,"Mar 18, 2021",I want a video game like this to exist imagine how cool that would be imagine if something like this was happening in the real world and we didn’t know it- I’d probably die there’s no way I’m the main character or some thing
7,"Mar 18, 2021",So what happen to the girl
7,"Mar 18, 2021",It reminds me of microhunter (and the gamer has these windows too!) 
7,"Mar 18, 2021",Did sangha survive? If so how? 
7,"Mar 12, 2021",did he help the girl? im totally not interested in Edgelord surviving but he might cause that lady was badly hurt
7,"Mar 11, 2021",haki 
7,"Mar 9, 2021",DAYUMMMM THIS IS SOW FUCKIN COOL
7,"Mar 9, 2021",Dojika definitely feels like one of those kill fist types. Wonder how is sneak peek into the future going to affect his morality.
7,"Feb 26, 2021",Why does this remind me of Sword art online. Just the first part though.
7,"Feb 25, 2021",He looks like Kaido from Saiki K 🤭
7,"Feb 18, 2021",this kinda reminds me of micro hunter 
7,"Feb 18, 2021",Did that lady survive tho? 
7,"Feb 17, 2021",I DONT UNDERSTAND ANYTHING BUT THIS IS AWESOME BUT WHAT IS THIS ??????
7,"Feb 17, 2021","I really find ""System"" genre of series like this fascinating.
The likes of Solo-Levelling, Tomb Raider King, So what I'm a spider, Legendary Moonloght Cultivator, Max level Returner, Max Level Hero has returned, Dungeon Reset, The gamer, Dice and so much more. I hope they all get great endings. [Makes me wanna travel 10 years to the future and back just to read these series and how they end]"

7,"Dec 1, 2020","Wait, is the girl dead? (The girl from the beginning)"
7,"Nov 30, 2020",Allowing that character to die is going to alter the story so drastically 
7,"Nov 28, 2020",We all gangster till this is on its last episode 
7,"Nov 28, 2020",Dokja mean reader.
7,"Nov 28, 2020",Ok but like that ending kinda reminded me of sao how Kirito got op and basically couldn’t die

7,"Nov 26, 2020","bro, what about sangah though. she die?"

7,"Oct 15, 2020",that's shit was fucking 10B IQ. well good thing that every 1 point counts as a one point lvl up cuz if it wasent that way the Leveling up would have been a  pain in the ass because the more you lvl increases the amount of point u have to gather will increase.

7,"Oct 15, 2020",THERE'S NO COMIC IN THE WORLD THAT GETS ME THIS EXCITED
7,"Oct 15, 2020",At the last moment he realized he fucked up 
7,"Oct 15, 2020",I guess I should be happy that he broughtthe survival rate up from 2 to 5 even though we don’t really know what they’ll do later. I was worried about that dude dying what affect will it have on the story but now I’m thinking maybe he takes his place and joins with the protagonist instead. 
7,"Oct 15, 2020",Big Brain / THIS IS SOO COOOOOL
7,"Oct 15, 2020",I waited until my fear of blood was gone to read but now I love gore sooo. . . YA 🌚

7,"Oct 14, 2020",When u know youre OP
7,"Oct 13, 2020",deeper layers of skin have living cells. maybe the edgelord earned som points with that first cut

7,"Oct 11, 2020",Man Really Just Said It's Big Brain Time
7,"Oct 10, 2020",how does increasing stamina make one knife proof?
7,"Oct 10, 2020",he didn't even save the old lady though... :<
7,"Oct 9, 2020","He makes me think of Kirito from Sword Art Online. Also doesn't this change the story? If he was an important character who joins the protagonist, isn't letting him die messing things up?"
7,"Oct 7, 2020",AAAAAHHHHH HES SUCH A KING 
7,"Oct 7, 2020","""you think you'll be a teenager forever?"" king gnu reference!!!??"

7,"Oct 1, 2020","i hate to day this,but for a few moment's i thought i misread it as ""dodgeball"""
7,"Sep 28, 2020",Is it kind of wrong that I think this is similar but better that SAO
7,"Sep 27, 2020",This guy became NightEye
7,"Sep 27, 2020","HEAVEN,A"
7,"Sep 27, 2020",Ahhh do smart and cool he’s a genius !!! Survivor is  like his new code name !!! :P✨💕🌸💓🌸🎉💞💖💖👍💛👍🌟🥳🌸🎊
7,"Sep 27, 2020",noooooo why would you have him die. and why tf did he not just go kill someone else ffs
7,"Sep 26, 2020",Victory!
7,"Sep 26, 2020",Ooooh dang 
7,"Sep 25, 2020",Killing Namwoon would change the entire plot of TWSA so unless he plans on taking Namwoon’s identity he wint be able to know what hapoebs next in the story. Unless somehow Namwoon actually survived...like if the grandma died before the countdown
7,"Sep 25, 2020","I’ve always wondered if this might happen, and I could’ve have made this series any better!!"
7,"Sep 25, 2020","Mm, he looked really scary here Σ（ﾟдﾟlll）"
7,"Sep 25, 2020","I feel genuinely bummed about namwoon dying, am I an asshole?"
7,"Sep 25, 2020",this reminds me of solo leveling... like alot
7,"Sep 24, 2020",Wait... if he let one of the characters of the story die... when they weren't supposed to... wouldn't that alter the story? Thus the story wouldn't be a reliable source of info for the apocalypse... right?
7,"Sep 23, 2020",if i were him i would not have been able to survive coz i can’t stand insects ;-;
7,"Sep 23, 2020",playing rpg stamina is for only speed and energy and vit is only for tanker than can never getting dmg by low class
7,"Sep 23, 2020",he is king crimson now
7,"Sep 23, 2020",When he said organism I got hella scared
7,"Sep 22, 2020",as expected as the creator of solo leveling.
7,"Sep 22, 2020",This animation got me like 😭 Yessss solo leveling! I fw it!
7,"Sep 21, 2020",now it's getting great!
7,"Sep 21, 2020",cant he just like put on some sanitizer and get a billion points even with the halving disadvantage
7,"Sep 21, 2020",looks like Tony Stark made a new invention! The invisible suit with special coin and level features. it's new and improved and only 15 billion dollars! 
7,"Sep 21, 2020","wait, he couldve shared it with the others, the kid etc"
7,"Sep 21, 2020","So no wonder he gained a lot of those, coincidence? I think NOT!"
7,"Sep 21, 2020",atleast their deaths will be quick
7,"Sep 21, 2020",This reminded me of SAO.🤔Have a great feeling that I’m going to love these series...
7,"Sep 20, 2020",girliee im ready to fangirl on webtoon now <3 not much to fangirl since i already read this miles ahead alrdy 😔
7,"Sep 20, 2020",Holy shit. This guy... woah. I like that he's not that guy who'd throw his life away for a total stranger.
7,"Sep 20, 2020",why won't you die? op stats son they activate on response to phisical trauma. You can't hurt me kim
7,"Sep 20, 2020",when your inner crazy come out
7,"Sep 20, 2020",why did not he kill that bug at the begining 
7,"Sep 19, 2020",Did his friend survive? The girl?
7,"Sep 19, 2020",Unless he's ridiculously lucky. I think someone else could've also killed one of the grasshoppers that had eggs. 
7,"Sep 18, 2020",The mc is a real cheater. It's like his the all knowing God. 
7,"Sep 18, 2020",Nice reaction just like season 1 of Solo leveling
7,"Sep 17, 2020",awww Kim was Sooo cute but dokja's face was catching😍
7,"Sep 17, 2020","Wait, how can the Edgelord die? Didn’t MC read about him being alive at a later stage?"
7,"Sep 17, 2020",if this was real I'll have another reason to kill spiders
7,"Sep 17, 2020",It reminds me of Dice in a way. I like it ^^
7,"Sep 17, 2020",Omgshh
7,"Sep 16, 2020",I'm starting to enjoy this. 
7,"Sep 16, 2020",Why didn’t he just kill the granny
7,"Sep 16, 2020",why they both so hawt.
7,"Sep 16, 2020","I hope the girl survived, rip ship if not"
7,"Sep 16, 2020",1 MILION IQ HAHAHAHAHHAH
7,"Sep 16, 2020",dang i hate how slow THIS IS. WEBTOON REALLY IS HPLDING A LOT OF EPISODES TO THEIRSELVES
7,"Sep 16, 2020",So... eggs are separate living organisms? You’d think that the entity who’s setting up mass murder wouldn’t be a pro-lifer. 
7,"Sep 16, 2020","So your saying that he has 100,100 coins!?!?!?!? and only spent 2,700 on stamina "
7,"Sep 16, 2020",sharingan no jutsu
7,"Sep 16, 2020",So far I’m loving this keep it up
7,"Sep 15, 2020","Oh, ok, the debt must be their lives or the hardship of trying to survive until the end instead of the coins🤔..."
7,"Sep 15, 2020",how is that stamina 
7,"Sep 15, 2020",good shit mate
7,"Sep 15, 2020",Just wondering but what if we all are in the same scenario?
7,"Sep 15, 2020",damn shit just got real 
7,"Sep 15, 2020",Waaaaiiiiit I don’t remember seeing the old lady killing anything so did he just save her only for her to die? And also what happened to the lady that was with him earlier? He could’ve saved all those people with those eggs 😞
7,"Sep 15, 2020",Big brain time

7,"Sep 9, 2020",what about the girl did she make it 😰

7,"Sep 9, 2020",The art is like Solo Leveling 
7,"Sep 9, 2020",Is it just me or it's annoying to figure out that other languages can read all chapters without paying a fast pass ??
7,"Sep 9, 2020","I lowky already miss the edge lord kid. He was funny, and has a great character but still a bad person"
7,"Sep 9, 2020",lil bitch

7,"Sep 9, 2020",Kim Namwoon was one the better characters in the novel... sad to see him die so soon 😂😂😂
7,"Sep 9, 2020",So he's basically Jihan Han but older.
7,"Sep 9, 2020","Well that's nice and all, but his lady friend didn't get to squish a bug either."
7,"Sep 9, 2020",Did you gave an insect to that girl you are travelling with? If not then is she dead?

7,"Sep 9, 2020",How I would love to be a part of such a situation....... This webtoon is soooo clean and amazing!!
7,"Sep 9, 2020",this guy knows how to leave cliffhangers on this comic. I'm hooked!
7,"Sep 9, 2020",I binged the whole thing and loved every single one of the episodes. You left me thinking and thinking about what would happen next. Thank u
7,"Sep 9, 2020",Loving this story so far. I hope this will be more amazing as it continues to progress. 
7,"Sep 9, 2020",The 'Yes!' when he crushed that bug reminded me of Jotaro.
7,"Sep 9, 2020",noice
7,"Sep 9, 2020",whatever happened to Sanga Yu? 
7,"Sep 9, 2020",this is reminding me of that webtoon dice
7,"Sep 9, 2020",THAT WAS A DREAM CLUTCH
7,"Sep 9, 2020",WHAT ABOUT THE GIRL???
7,"Sep 9, 2020",big brain
7,"Sep 9, 2020",Man rly is metagaming king
7,"Sep 9, 2020",read online i think there's 20 chapters 
7,"Sep 9, 2020",he just pulled a dream move on him
7,"Sep 9, 2020",Stupid pay-to-win players
7,"Sep 9, 2020",Tell me that is a higher level version of Spidey sense.
7,"Sep 9, 2020","so I guess he changed the story, since that guy is dead now?"
7,"Sep 9, 2020",It’s so good!
7,"Sep 9, 2020",so... he let the old lady die??
7,"Sep 9, 2020",Soo. What happened to the granny?
7,"Sep 9, 2020",cool
7,"Sep 9, 2020",That was so awesome!!!!!!
7,"Sep 9, 2020",This mans got a whole aśš sharingan 
7,"Sep 9, 2020","idk why but I am still in awe after seeing sangah. QnQ Yes, I still love Sangah. QnQ"
7,"Sep 9, 2020",well.
7,"Sep 9, 2020",That's such a JoJo-type moment
7,"Sep 9, 2020",I absolutely loved this episode
7,"Sep 9, 2020",badass
7,"Sep 9, 2020",One of the best moments from this story
7,"Sep 9, 2020","Got serious snk vibes from ""the strong prey on the weak""... it might be a direct quotation "
7,"Sep 9, 2020","Yes, Solo Leveling!!!"
7,"Sep 9, 2020",Rose Lalond would most definitely be an Edgelord omg xD GRIMDARK!?!!
7,"Sep 9, 2020","hah, dat was a quick run😲😲😲"
7,"Sep 9, 2020","they called the skill ""edgelord-grimdark awakening"". lol. "
7,"Sep 9, 2020",This is an amazing webcomic!!
7,"Sep 9, 2020","im still curious , wtf happened to the girl he was with?!"
7,"Sep 9, 2020",is the girl still alive?
7,"Sep 9, 2020",He Bofuri'd 😂
7,"Sep 9, 2020",I wanted him to live 
7,"Sep 9, 2020",but the question is how from where did he got a raw egg 
7,"Sep 9, 2020",I just read the Korean ver of this and this is much more understandable lol 
7,"Sep 9, 2020",I just realized this is The Gamer webtoon but edgy (#MAKE THE GAMER AN ANIME)
7,"Sep 9, 2020",this reminds of the gamer
7,"Sep 9, 2020",The Gamer vibes for real though.
7,"Sep 9, 2020",wait.... but the grandma didn’t kill any living organism.. so she still died.... |•-•”|
7,"Sep 9, 2020",I’m seriously hooked- he reminds me of a more emotional L
7,"Sep 9, 2020",go kill a spider egg sack 
7,"Sep 9, 2020","5?? ok so stuff did change from what he originally read, right? since he's there now to change things"
7,"Sep 9, 2020","but,the granny will die in the end cuz she did not kill any organism...so,my point is, no matter what,the mc effort is pointless at the end,but that is just to satisfy their own humanity value"
7,"Sep 9, 2020",In the light novel this scene was a little harder to read because towards the end he started begging to be saved
7,"Sep 9, 2020",amazing.
7,"Sep 9, 2020",Reminds me of the gamer 
7,"Sep 9, 2020",That chapter was fire 🔥 🔥 straight fuego 
7,"Sep 9, 2020","To be honest, I kind of wanted angry guy to survive"
7,"Sep 9, 2020",So did edgelord die or not?
7,"Sep 9, 2020",EGDELORD ATTRIBUTE I CANT -
7,"Sep 9, 2020",this is basically large scale Saw games
7,"Sep 9, 2020",The white haired psycho sort of reminded me of Bakugou. If this someday has an anime adaptation I really hope they have the same voice actor.
7,"Sep 9, 2020",x👄x
7,"Sep 9, 2020",if the story is supposed to play out similar to the novel then wouldn't that mean this webtoon is going to be over 3000 episodes long🙃
7,"Sep 9, 2020",Dope
7,"Sep 9, 2020",Did he just accidentally kill her?
7,"Sep 9, 2020",Why does it seem like this doesn't have a huge following yet....?
7,"Sep 9, 2020",I’m reading this while listening to baby shark 😂. My lil cousin wanted it lmao 
7,"Sep 9, 2020",fucking cold badass
7,"Sep 9, 2020",Wowie!!!  Boy be changing everything!! 😁😁
7,"Sep 9, 2020","Woah, he can think about something like that in a split second? And here I am jumping in front of a car  without looking and playing hopscotch to get out of its way"

7,"Aug 28, 2020",I may have spent 5 coins on this episode but I have 10 more
7,"Aug 28, 2020",I love this so much 😭
7,"Aug 27, 2020",I want to see how people level up more. This webtoon is great. First time reader of the series and I'm already (s)hooked. 🖤
7,"Aug 27, 2020",that's pretty cool about the eggs part 
7,"Aug 27, 2020",It's getting interesting
7,"Aug 27, 2020",This was really really good. 
7,"Aug 27, 2020",dang it. I ran out ofcoins to fast pass more. really glad this came to webtoons as i probably never would have heard of this story otherwise and that would be a very sad thing.
7,"Aug 26, 2020",My coins are gone... Well it was worth it
7,"Aug 26, 2020",I'm broke now. :( *sighs* I'll guess I have to wait.

7,"Aug 26, 2020",not expecting to use coins but it was worth it it was really good. looks like i'll have my wallet empty this time
7,"Aug 26, 2020",Definitely like where the story is going even if it is real similar to Solo Leveling with a system. Going to be interesting to see if anyone else has read a good bit of the same story as him and can alter the story.
7,"Aug 26, 2020",I just blew through coins and now I gotta wait 3 weeks for the next episode
7,"Aug 26, 2020",Yussss I can finally draw fanart of the characters

7,"Sep 11, 2020",cant wait for more and I think the creator is the person who made solo leveling like look at the art and the story line
7,"Sep 10, 2020",am i the only one that wanted the white haired dude to live and tbh its because i actually agree with him ngl im not a very nice person but i really hope he survives :(
7,"Sep 10, 2020","awwwww dang it namwoon kim is the type of character I mostly like, wild and dangerous, very chaotic and quite a psychopath. But proven to be Tenacious and Powerful, such a waste ;3;"

7,"Sep 9, 2020","Well, probably lost part of its advantage to know what might happen next. According to what he said in previous chapters, only 2 people were supposed to survive in that cabin: the Edgelord and the Military Guy, who were going to join the main hero of the story. Since 5 of them survived, now he shouldn't have the advantage to know how the story will evolve till the end, because he's changed some core elements of its beginning! 😐"
7,"Sep 9, 2020",so he rescued the old Lady to let her die because she didn't  kill anything? and the boy from whom he got the insects is also done?
7,"Sep 9, 2020",the solo leveling vibes omgg im in love
7,"Sep 9, 2020",I still believe Edge Lord is still alive. edited - i shouldn't of commented this as I was spoiled twice but saves me investing my time into this
7,"Sep 9, 2020",Why did he bother killing the bug at the start if he still had another pregnant one?
7,"Sep 9, 2020",Ok but is the girl still alive??
7,"Sep 9, 2020",ah what about the female lead? does she survive?

7,"Sep 10, 2020",wtf episode 6?! its already chapter 21 in other weebton website...
7,"Sep 9, 2020",So he could have saved everyone on the train cart ? huuummmmm

7,"Aug 19, 2020",am i the only one who's grossed out by the fact that he SQUISHED the bug in his HANDS 🤢
7,"May 13, 2021",How he keep dat roach in his pocket the whole time???? logic is out the window so say goodbye 
7,"Nov 10, 2020",It reminds me of The Gamer and Solo leveling and its GREAT
7,"Oct 21, 2020",it's like solo leveling I Love it 👍👍🔥
7,"Oct 18, 2020","What if he knew that he could have saved everyone!!! There was enough eggs for everyone, in the end he didn’t even save the grandma, he just killed the teen. All those peoples deaths are on him. "
7,"Sep 25, 2020","So im super lost, didnt the granny just die either way since she didnt clear the mission. In the same vain didnt he also ruin the survival of others by acting all pacifist"
7,"Sep 16, 2020",The protagonist is like a monster!!! Did he really just kill all those people by not sharing the Grasshopper‘s eggs???!!!
7,"Aug 27, 2020",if eggs still in the grasshopper are considered alive then babies in the womb are too :/ getting political up in here
7,"Sep 10, 2020",Literally was thinking about this comic all of last night cuz it's so awesome then the next day it turned into the apocalypse where I live. (All the smoke California and Oregon fires West Coast USA gathered where I live making the sky so dark everyone had the lights on to see at noon)
7,"Sep 9, 2020","I'm sorry, are we going to overlook the fact he had AT LEAST 26-27 larvae with him he used on himself alone? After he killed the first bug, he could have given one to each passenger and save everyone in that cabin! Is he a ""Chaotic Good"" kind of hero? 🤔 "
7,"Oct 29, 2021",if mc is protector of justice kinda guy... this is going to be a very boring one.. 😒😒
7,"Feb 4, 2021",is this SOLO LEVELING SEASON 2????
7,"Nov 18, 2020",He could have saved everyone with those eggs :(
7,"Oct 18, 2020",I feel like dice and Gamer had a baby and made this Webtoon. I'm so here for it! 😍
7,"Sep 9, 2020",People really forgot about his new “girlfriend” what happened to her. Everyone in the train probably died including her bruh that’s sad I was shipping it too.
7,"Sep 9, 2020",Why the hell does Namwoon look and behave like a shittier version of Accelerator?!
7,"Sep 9, 2020",what about sanga???.....she is suppose to be heroine of the story .......she can't die ......
7,"Apr 29, 2021",I kinda ship Dokja with Namwoon even though I know this teenage edgelord is a psychopath. 
7,"Sep 9, 2020","""Hero"" here just murdered all but five of the people in the cabin by taking all the eggs for himself. Even the 'half of us kill the other half' plan would have had a lower body count."
7,"Sep 12, 2020",Go online and there are like 20 chaps
7,"Sep 11, 2020","damn he could have saved everyone in the car with those eggs... He's kind of a hypocrite. EDIT: You huys are totally right and im not saying he's gotta be a hero, but if thats the case then why is he judging the edge lord and everyone else for killing someone if he was just going to kill them all?! He let the grandma die too. So, hes no better than those people really....."
7,"Sep 9, 2020",why do i feel like the main charterer was in the wrong here i mean you through all the bugs killing a couple of people you didn't give any back to the child so he dead and it is kill or be killed the granny was gonna die anyway from you not giving her anything to kill and that if she doesn't kill a bug and maybe just died from a heart attack there isn't anymore hospitals so yeah good job bro.
