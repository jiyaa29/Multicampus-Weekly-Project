Episode,Date,Review
109,"Jun 15, 2022","I'M GUESSING WE ALL HAD THE SAME EXPRESSIONS AS THE ENFORCERS IN THAT PANEL? BECAUSE THAT SMILE AND ""KEKEKE"" IS BEAUTIFUL I'M GONNA CRY"
109,"Jun 15, 2022","THE ENFORCERS ACTUALLY FLATTERED BIHYUNG, BUT I GUESS IT WAS CUT OFF. // [Dokkaebi Bihyung. He is a very good dokkaebi. Look at his humility. He has the integrity of a streamer who ignores everything and immerses himself in the scenarios. It is different from you and the dokkaebis who only wear luxurious clothing.]Bihyung had a shy expression on his face. He didn't know that his poverty would help him in this way."
109,"Jun 15, 2022",That last panel though 😭
109,"Jun 15, 2022",remember kids. punishable with a fee just means legal for a price.
109,"Jun 15, 2022",That creepy smile the enforcers made is fantastically evil.👏
109,"Jun 15, 2022","If we divide Dokja's total coins: 205, 902 by 500, he'll get to hit Paul exactly 411 times before going broke 🤩💫"
109,"Jun 15, 2022",Paul: Is it too late to say sorry? Dokja: (opens wallet)
109,"Jun 15, 2022","Money can't buy happiness, but it can buy you a private meeting with Paul.. same thing"
109,"Jun 15, 2022",Bro even the enforcers knew what Dokja was doing😂 that’s why they allowed the meeting.
109,"Jun 15, 2022",Dokja: I want a private meeting with him 👉🏾🙀Enforcers: 🤩🤩 we got time for that 😈😈
109,"Jun 15, 2022",I know ya’ll are smiling like crazy people too with this episode lol
109,"Jun 15, 2022","Dokja: *approaches Paul*.                                  Paul: ""Hang on, why do I hear boss music?"" "
109,"Jun 15, 2022","Those last two shots of Dokja are really sad. Yeah he is getting some revenge, but he already knows it doesn't change anything or remove his guilt for how it played out. He is following through because he believes its the right thing to do to keep his promises. He seems so empty here."
109,"Jun 15, 2022","Be me.Wonder if the enforcers were smirking cause they're evil or something. 
Finish chapter. 
Realize your smirking as evilly as the enforcers

Get rekt Paul"
109,"Jun 15, 2022","Dokja Fr went “Screw the rules, I have Money”"
109,"Jun 15, 2022","I can only imagine the guards are us, smiling like true villains at interesting events. Really wish he could stream this beating, I can only imagine the constellations hooting and hollering at a satisfying beating to someone making a tear jerking scenario, especially because it’s a dokkebi getting their arse whooped "
109,"Jun 15, 2022","It's insanely satisfying to watch Dokja pummel the crap out of Paul, but that thousand yard stare of his.... Dokja is not ok right now. This poor dude worked so hard to change the tragic fate of a girl who suffered so much, only for this slime bag to flip the script upside down and exploit the system for the sake of punishing the incarnations he assumed were below him. I don't think there's much of a scheme this time. I think Dokja is just fed up with the bullshit and intends to unleash that."
109,"Jun 15, 2022",That last panel reminds me of Anya’s “Heh’ expression. 😂😂
109,"Jun 15, 2022",sweet justice. and the smirk from the enforcers omg. i about died laughing
109,"Jun 15, 2022",My man legit said he'd pay the tax... oof. I look forward to many follow up hits like that one hehehe.
109,"Jun 15, 2022",This by far was my most satisfying fast pass for this series yet. Just when this was starting to feel so predictable this loss and Mc quick wit to get even is very refreshing oh that hit was cathartic asf and I really appreciate how the build up of hate for Paul isn't being dragged our on getting some feel good licks in at least... looking at you Tower of God. 10 out of 10 I wish they gave MC more menacing shots tho like they do for solo leveling tho
109,"Jun 18, 2022","""Private Meeting"" was just code for ""Dokkaebi Pinata"" lmao"
109,"Jun 15, 2022","AHAHAHAHAHAHHAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAAAAAAA!  GET REKT, YOU OVERPRIVELEGED CROSS BETWEEN A MOUTAIN GOAT AND A POMERANIAN. This was worth the wait, OMG. Yessssss."
109,"Jun 15, 2022",Amassed the most coins out of any player (presumably) just so he can beat up Paul for 20 minutes....that's my kind of petty 🤣
109,"Jun 15, 2022",Lol the enforcers knew exactly what Dokja had in mind. 🤣😂🤣😂
109,"Jun 15, 2022","In case anyone's curious, Dokja can afford 411 punches. Get rekt Paul 👻"
109,"Jun 15, 2022",BIHYUNG'S EXPRESSION ON THAT ONE PANEL THOUGH LOL
109,"Jun 15, 2022",I am yet to meet a decent Paul.
109,"Jun 15, 2022",AND THAT'S WHEN HE KNEW..HE FCKED UP
109,"Jun 15, 2022",bro is going to get beat
109,"Jun 18, 2022",Paul literally got trolled. That's the most twitch/twitter thing I've ever seen from a work of fiction with a spinoff streaming platform.
109,"Jul 20, 2022",LOVE HOW HE PUT THE APOCALYPSE ON HOLD FOR A SEC SO HE COULD BEAT SOME A$$
109,"Jul 20, 2022",Bihyeong acting like a scammer just like Dokja <3333

109,"Jun 15, 2022",That is an unbelievable amount of coin that still somehow doesn't break the rule of plausibility
109,"Jul 6, 2022",Time for a private party and Dokja is bringing all the greatest hits.
109,"Jun 15, 2022",the 1st promise is about to be kept.. the 2nd promise will take a while.. 
109,"Jun 20, 2022",the enforcers paused while they thought about it... then just were like GAH DAMN THIS GUY SMART
109,"Jun 15, 2022",why can't my wallet say 20000+ coins? webtoons really making me broke just cuz I want to Paul get punched lol
109,"Jun 22, 2022","""I WAS SET UP"" yes Paul your DUMBASS, you did it to yourself because o your grudge toward Dokja!!! Turn out the the scenario control returned to Dokjscam hands as always"
109,"Jun 17, 2022",That panel with the enforcers smile was pretty intimidating if you were to put yourself on the scale they should have been. it said everything in a second because I bet they got to see his balance of coins XD
109,"Jul 20, 2022","Cold, hard, REVENGE. And to a guy who really, really, deserves it."
109,"Jun 17, 2022","the enforcers fucking new he was rich and was gonna kick Paul's ass, look at the evil smiles they have"
109,"Jun 15, 2022",Holy shit the enforcers are cool. Also ive never smiled faster in the last bit
109,"Jun 15, 2022",The PAUL BEATING!!!! arguably one of the best scene of the serie ^-^ THE PAUL BEATING!!!!!!! 
109,"Jul 26, 2022","Rest in Peace Seong-rak Jang, your work will never be forgotten"
109,"Jun 20, 2022","You took our beautiful broken wild lady from us, I've never been okay with torture but a righteous beatdown. A Constilation Who Speaks for Vermin is awaiting justice."

109,"Jul 20, 2022","DAAAAMNNNN THAT PUNCH THOUGH, I LOVED IT!!!!"
109,"Jul 20, 2022",I did the math- Dokja can more or less hit Paul about 411 times until he kind of runs low in money so 👀👀
109,"Jun 15, 2022","I really thought Kim Dokja was going to come up with some brilliant scheme to benefit from Paul getting arrested. I mean, I wasn't expecting it to be in THAT way but it works all the same for me. Paul deserves to suffer😈"
109,"Jun 15, 2022",It's like the super rich people who still swear even though it costs 10k an f-bomb. 
109,"Jun 15, 2022","500 coins per punch with a starting total of 200,000+, that’s a free 400 hits and each one would feel so nice"

109,"Jul 21, 2022","I saw that Level 1 Munchkin among the constellations, what a perfect reference"
109,"Jul 21, 2022",can someone explain the rules? I'm still confused as to what Paul did wrong to get punished. didn't the majority of d constellations agreed with d scenario enforcement at the time it was enforced? does it not count now that they left? I'm confused.
109,"Jul 21, 2022",This is the moment I've been waiting to see since they started the adaptation of the novel. The idea of punching a dokaebi seems so satisfying.
109,"Jul 20, 2022",GUYSSSS I HAVE A THEORY!! SO YOU GUYS KNOW THE CONSTELLATION NAMED SECRETIVE PLOTTER RIGHT? WHAT IF THAT IS ACTUALLY THE AUTHORRR SINCE HE WASNT IN THE NOVEL AND MC DOESNT SEEM RO KNOW ABOUT IT!!!!!

109,"Jun 15, 2022",It just accrued to me that we are the constellations of this WEBTOON.....and dokja is our incarnation I mean think about it We are paying in coins 🪙 to keep getting more action and content from this AMAZING MASTER PIECE BTW I will gladly keep on paying to get more of this awesome WEBTOON . I am wishing for a day where we'll get one day 5 episodes at once

109,"Jul 23, 2022",RIP Paul 💀
109,"Jul 22, 2022",Dokja is the definition of 'Fuck You Money'.
109,"Jul 21, 2022",I'm not surprised that Dokja called a private meeting with him. He basically had to watch his adopted daughter die in front of him. I would have done the same.
109,"Jul 21, 2022","ah yes, Whaling"
109,"Jul 21, 2022",Constellation [Side Character 9] Screams in rage as his coins are gone and there is no table to flip
109,"Jul 21, 2022",The people in the comments who expand on certain situations or explain them with passages from the novel are literally godsends
109,"Jul 21, 2022",lmao. The Enforcers laughed because they knew exactly what was going to happen. 
109,"Jul 20, 2022","since enforcers are ex constellations turned dokkaebi, makes you even more curious about the mystery of what dokkaebis even are"

"
109,"Jul 20, 2022",Omg the Enforcers looked a little creepy with their smile! But they were totally more than happy to have Dokja have a private meeting 💀 They probably knew what was coming.

109,"Jun 16, 2022","Dokja looks so hurt in that last panel. the emptiness in his eyes... i could feel his pain. He wants to cry, I am sure of it. But the only way he can take those tears out is by beating up Paul.......good. Paul deserves it, and a million more."
109,"Jun 16, 2022","damnit those beautiful smiles, wish I could screenshot that."
109,"Jun 15, 2022",HAHAHAHAHAHAAHAHAHAHAH F*CK YOU PAUL

109,"Jul 22, 2022",this was fun... I wonder how many constellations are donating 500 coins with a message [Hit him once for me]
109,"Jul 22, 2022",Enjoy your 20 minute “meeting”

109,"Jul 21, 2022",The amount of i dont give a damn on his face😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣
109,"Jul 21, 2022",i still can’t get over the fact that his name is paul
109,"Jul 21, 2022",Dokja really did finesse Paul. I had no idea what his intentions were with the private meeting. I wondered if it was blackmail or something but just plain old kicking his ass is so satisfying to watch. The enforcers when they heard Dokja wanted a private meeting with Paul. Kekekeke. The most cathartic punch ever and Paul realizing Dokja had enough coins to beat him up 😁
109,"Jul 20, 2022","forget Fourth Wall ... his real secret ability is ""I'm Rich AF"""
109,"Jul 20, 2022","20 minutes later: Dokja- Nice talking to you, Paul."

109,"Jul 20, 2022","Just when you think this story cannot get any greater and more epic, Dokja lands a so deserved punch and we're all cheering"
109,"Jul 20, 2022",Love the way the enforcers look. Really cool armour.. But that creepy smile? Holy f... Scary! 
109,"Jul 20, 2022","""Secretive Plotter is mocking Paul"" Guys, are we Secretive Plotter? I know for a fact that I wasn't the only one laughing at the fact that his name is Paul!"

109,"Jun 16, 2022","Judging by his funds, he can punch Paul 411 times or 6.85 times per minute, assuming he will want to save at least 100,000 coins then he’ll be able to punch Paul 211 times or 3.52 times per minute. Either way, paul’s in for hell,"

109,"Jul 21, 2022",He can hit him about 410 times
109,"Jul 21, 2022",It’s so good to see this scene finally drawn
109,"Jul 21, 2022","Dokja: I'd like a private meetingEnforcers: (ooooooh shiiiiiiit, it's about to get good) "
109,"Jul 21, 2022",I did the math and if it’s correct he would have to hit him 411 times to run out of coin 
109,"Jul 21, 2022",enforcers literally be like KEKW
109,"Jul 21, 2022","Dokja's expression in the end hurt me. The bitterness in his face when he said he earned the coins thanks to Paul... Serves him right, I hope he suffers for many years to come for hurting my baby Yuseung ✋🏻 and the way Bihyeong reacted was so Dokja 😂 he's learning some tricks now"
109,"Jul 21, 2022",Can the constellations see him beating Paul up? They’ll def keep giving dokja more money just to see it keep going lmao 
109,"Jul 21, 2022",The Enforcers allowing it because they're sadistic 😂
109,"Jul 21, 2022","Finally!I can see it visually! 
That's satisfaction right there"
109,"Jul 21, 2022",the enforcers are a moooddd🤣 but yes. dokja crush paull
109,"Jul 21, 2022",KicK hIS ASS sEabaSs
109,"Jul 21, 2022",Dude that means that if he uses all his coins and the price for a hit dose go up he can hit Paul 411 times
109,"Jul 21, 2022",Bro said “thanks for your money now I’ll use it to beat you”
109,"Jul 21, 2022","Can we all agree Dokja is absolutely fine af, and seeing him go God mode playing the system like a well tuned instrument makes him even HOTTER. BEAT PAUL UP BABY, GET IT! "
109,"Jul 21, 2022",I literally smiled the same way the enforcers did 😌 I wish I could give some more coins to Dokja 
109,"Jul 21, 2022",he can punch him about 400 times :)
109,"Jul 20, 2022","Yooo! Holy crap, Dokja keeps being such a badass! Omniscient reader with the dope chapters 🔥🔥"
109,"Jul 20, 2022",hit him harder and keep going until you're as broke as us
109,"Jul 20, 2022",dokja be pulling out uno reverses nonstop

109,"Jul 20, 2022",nooo I wanted to see him beat the dokkebi for 19 minutes before the chapter end XD
109,"Jul 20, 2022",My dude has 411 more hits he can dish out
109,"Jul 20, 2022","If he doesn't get any donations, he has 501 hits max. But seeing a Dokkaebi getting the crap being beaten out of him? I'm certain the Constellations would pay plenty to see such a unique event unfold!"
109,"Jul 20, 2022",the cliffhangers this comic gives is downright rude. I wanna know what happens next! Don't cut me off like that. 😩😩😩
109,"Jul 20, 2022","the sweet sweet smell of revenge lingers in the sphere , delicious aroma wafts pass the bystanders and enforcers you have been gifted...wait you don't need anymore coins! Dokja you rollin in the dough . when he said I'll give you 100k I was like woah..sponsor us some coins for fast passes please "
109,"Jul 20, 2022",Paul you fucked up and.the kekeke scared the shit out of me. and poor dokja the lifeless face he has at the end. 
109,"Jul 20, 2022",Money ain't everything right? Well go tell Dokja that.😁😁✔️
109,"Jul 20, 2022",1: The enforcer smiles were great!2: love the Robert Frost reference!

109,"Jul 20, 2022",Those two enforcers are my new favorite characters bruh they were ready for Dokja to brawl 😭
109,"Jul 20, 2022",He has 411 hits left. Will he run out of coins or time first?
109,"Jul 20, 2022","bihyung was adorable in this chapter specially in the part where he got flattered by the enforcers, i actually wanted to see shy bihung but i guess it had to get cut off due to maximum panels in webtoon"
109,"Jul 20, 2022",We really be like the enforcers huh? Kekekekekeke
109,"Jul 20, 2022",nice.
109,"Jul 20, 2022",Suffer! Paul about to get the whoopin' of his life lol
109,"Jul 20, 2022","You reap what you sow Paul, and now Dokja is going to deliver some justice. Also I didn't know that enforcers were dokkaebi too."
109,"Jul 20, 2022","The Enforcers.... I LOVE THOSE FREAKING FANGED GRINS... GIVE ME MORE TOOTHY ENFORCER GRINS, THEY WARM MY BLACKENED SOUL! XD YEEEES!"
109,"Jul 20, 2022","congratulations, you have just figured out why capitalism is a bad thing"
109,"Jul 20, 2022","the arc made me sob. like it was literally draining. but IM STILL NOT OVER THE FACT THAT THE DOKKAEBI'S NAME IS PAUL LIKE HELLO??? UOURE TELLING ME I CRIED OVER SHIT THAT A STUPID ASS MF NAMED PAUL BEGAN?? I CANNOT RN.
love that he got a beating by dokja tho. he slays everytime. (i sometimes wanna be as rich as dokja damn.)"
109,"Jul 20, 2022",damn🌚
109,"Jul 20, 2022","When I saw that my favorite webtoon has a new episode, I doubted if I should read it or not, but because I'm stubborn I read it till the last panel and this is the first time that I felt satisfied by the cliffhanger( ꈍᴗꈍ)"
109,"Jul 20, 2022","Sigh, I still can't get over it. "
109,"Jul 20, 2022",these 'constellations' get on my nerves man. it's like watching how the media treats an artist unfairly 😂😂
109,"Jul 20, 2022",I already know what's going to happen but somehow I still want to spend coins to keep reading!! It's just so good TT
109,"Jul 20, 2022",Wait so are the Dokkaebi previous constellations or just the enforcers?
109,"Jul 20, 2022",I can't..  his name is Paul..  Paul.. 
109,"Jul 20, 2022",bish imma beat you up with the money you paid me
109,"Jul 20, 2022","It took one-third of the coins he had to become a platinum member. But at the same time, it ONLY took one-third of the coins he had to become a platinum member. The sheer flex of ""I have enough coins to burn on penalties"" should not be this satisfying, but it is."
109,"Jul 20, 2022",Let’s get ready for a beat down…
109,"Jul 20, 2022",Coldest mf of the year award goes to Dokja. I feel like the constellations will feed him coins to continue BAHAHAA

109,"Jul 20, 2022",This really does put a smile on my face.
109,"Jul 20, 2022","Don’t worry, he’s got his bail money"
109,"Jul 20, 2022",That dead stare tho
109,"Jul 20, 2022","According to the penalty, and how many coins Dokja has, Dokja can hit Paul 411 times."
109,"Jul 20, 2022","Dokja looked genuinely pissed there in the last panel I kinda feel bad for what is about to happen to Paul.
…barely"
109,"Jul 20, 2022",I have been waiting for this moment!!!!
109,"Jul 20, 2022","Those enforcers new what was going to happen, and they probably enjoyed it as much as we did"
109,"Jul 20, 2022",[The Constellation <Mad Logician> cackles in joy at this new development][500 coins have been sponsored!]
109,"Jul 20, 2022",The Enforcers had the same reaction as mine. I have come a long way without fast pass and the Dokkaebi is finally getting what he deserved. Fu-ck you Dokkaebi.

109,"Jul 20, 2022","Paul better have insurance....ass whooping insurance,and Dokja is going to withdraw a deductible."
109,"Jul 20, 2022",yeah GET HIS ASS!!

109,"Jul 20, 2022","OMFG, THIS IS SOOOOOOOO GOOOOOD!!!! When do I get to BUY a physical copy of this entire series??? The story, the art…. It’s just so PERFECT!!!!"
109,"Jul 20, 2022","I guess Dokja deciding to beat up that dokkaebi wasn't purely out of his own anger, but also because that little Yuseung had become full of hatred and bloodlust in her desire to kill that Dokkaebi. Him doing this would greatly decrease her anger. It was a good move"
109,"Jul 20, 2022",Someone's gonna wish to die tonight 😏
109,"Jul 20, 2022",This is what I call satisfying. The author made this dokkaebi especially annoying for a reason. So that we could feel the gratification when Dokja beats him to a pulp. 
109,"Jul 20, 2022","Forgive my French but BEAT PAULS ASSSSSS, CRUSH THAT LITTLE FURBALLS BONES AND MAKE HIM REGRET MESSING WITH YOUR FRIENDS!!!! (Sorry but this is my favorite webtoon even over God of Highschool and Hardcore)"

109,"Jul 20, 2022",Kim Dokja's popularity sure is going up 🤩
109,"Jul 20, 2022","lol, hit him again!"
109,"Jul 20, 2022",money by Lisa playing in the background 
109,"Jul 20, 2022",The amount of Dokja spend on this chapter is nothing compared to how much coins he will have in the future. 
109,"Jul 20, 2022","i love how he dont care about strategy or any plan, he just want to beat him up"
109,"Jul 20, 2022",I'm not sure if Paul was cursing or if he was speaking in the dokkaebi language that Bihyeong was speaking when the first scenario began. Wait... he was cursing in the dokkaebi language!
109,"Jul 20, 2022",I love that the enforcers said “No way…” and still allowed the private meeting. I really believe they are placing bets quietly
109,"Jul 20, 2022","205,902-500 per punch is equal to 411 punches, and he won't even need the full 20 minutes to land that many punches 😅😅. "

109,"Jul 20, 2022","He's full of surprises, and only good ones"
109,"Jul 20, 2022",i had to look at the last panel a few times to understand what he meant.(he got most of those coins from killing the catastrophe)
109,"Jul 20, 2022","""I request a private meeting with the mid-grade dokkaebi Paul"" 😶😶 Daaaaamn, it was already bad for him and it just gets worse, let's see what our dear Dokja has in store"
109,"Jul 20, 2022","""And only the constellations who are in support of Dokja remain in the channel"" he took a gamble and failed, I sure am glad he did"
109,"Jul 14, 2022",The fact that only Paul is the only one who liked what happened makes a bit satisfying but I still wish they can bring her back for this treachery...
109,"Jul 13, 2022","I like how the confusion, turns to snarkiness, then to anger, and finally fear."
109,"Jul 7, 2022",he really thought he was big talk then got folded by a gohan replica (cant fly but can beat the sh1t out of a professional saiyan if his life counts on it)

109,"Jun 17, 2022",That is ALOT of punches
109,"Jun 17, 2022",if my math is  right he can hit him about 411 times with a little coin left over
109,"Jun 17, 2022",20 mins damn he only needs 5 to destroy him the extra 15 will just be to truly break em
109,"Jun 16, 2022","Paul ""you can't do this!"" dokja *checks bank account* ""hmmmmm, I think i can"" *face punch*. qbsolutly amazing story telling keep up the truly awesome work you do author."

All the constellations: BEAT. HIS. ASS."
109,"Jun 16, 2022",It truly hurts to see the pain in his eyes for having failed due to the creature in-front of him
109,"Jun 15, 2022","lmao Secretive Plotter, you brilliant bastard. I bet you're the one who incited the bland violent scenario end to f*ck Paul. and now Dokja has the [entertained] attention of the Enforcers XD"
109,"Jun 15, 2022","Paul had it coming. More than once he could have let things play out, but nope and now he's definitely paying a price for it. Especially since just because you can't kill anyone in there, doesn't mean they will leave with more than 1HP lol"

109,"Jul 21, 2022",HAHAHAHA SUCK IT PAUL 
109,"Jul 21, 2022","I was wondering what he was planning when he interrupted Paul's judgement... so this was what it was. I can't complain, though it feels a little underhanded. May we not have Paul's meddling ever again."
109,"Jul 21, 2022",Bruh he really said 'I'm filthy rich your about to catch these hands boi'.
109,"Jul 21, 2022",GO GET HIM!!!!

109,"Jul 21, 2022","Yeah, the Constellations were all on your side...until it turned out to not be fun. Oh how the turntables, eh?"
109,"Jul 21, 2022",Paul is about to get that work
109,"Jul 21, 2022",absolutely beautiful.
109,"Jul 21, 2022",POV: when you go to one of you series and remember something good/exciting happened …. Literally what happened to me though
109,"Jul 21, 2022",Dokja showing us the advantages of pay to win
109,"Jul 21, 2022",Then enforcers knew what was coming. iv got some major respect for them and there beautiful smiles

109,"Jul 21, 2022",why there was a bitcoin ad after the last panel? lol
109,"Jul 21, 2022",I would give anything to be able to see Dokja feed him them hoes for a straight 20 minutes in real time. With that same smile on his face in the last panel the ENTIRE TIME. I would be cackling from the amount of sweet disrespect. My pettiness levels are on par with that of 50 Cent himself.
109,"Jul 21, 2022","Man them enforcers went from sounding regal in my head to like a bunch of savage dude bros. Lmao. My man Dokja actually said, ""I ain't gotta kill you I just need to give you THESE HANDS!!!"" I'm so proud!!!!!"
109,"Jul 21, 2022","1 Crore=10M right?.. so KD is the first Milionaire in our Apocalyptic world.. right? Or a billionaire maybe?🤔 // No I just checked.. with his coins, he's a trillionaire now"

109,"Jul 21, 2022",Mr.Kim Dokja standing there like a King.. asking the enforcerers for the private meeting... Man is so fine and I can't take back my word
109,"Jul 21, 2022","At this point Dokja can just use this phrase.. ""Don't let them know your next move""// (exceptions r the novel readers)"
109,"Jul 21, 2022",GO DOKJA GO
109,"Jul 21, 2022",Hands down the best way he spent his hard earned money so far

109,"Jul 21, 2022","Yes, make him wish he could die"
109,"Jul 21, 2022",the reflection of the fist in the glasses was 👨‍🍳💋
109,"Jul 21, 2022","I’m a little confused with this chapter, what exactly did Paul get in trouble for? "
109,"Jul 21, 2022",INSANE. 
109,"Jul 20, 2022",hey guys:) where can I read the official translation of the novel?
109,"Jul 20, 2022",This is going to be a looooong and expensive 20 minutes. Worth it
109,"Jul 20, 2022",YES FCK HIT HIM MORE!!!!!!! Also the enforcers are even scarier than I expected.
109,"Jul 20, 2022",This is what karma looks like.
109,"Jul 20, 2022","HHAHA OMFG this arrogant dokaebi, dokja’s sinister rich smile 😭😫. I honestly just find it so hilarious that his name is Paul 💀 I also wish I could see bihyeong as the constellation he used to be! I wonder what went wrong 🥺"

109,"Jul 20, 2022",Polywhop Paul!
109,"Jul 20, 2022",no but everytime I see dokja i go dreamy eyed ugliest king my a** he's the most beautiful 
109,"Jul 20, 2022","just wanted to ask, this is the primary source right? there's no book this is based on? "
109,"Jul 20, 2022",Its clobberin' time!
109,"Jul 20, 2022","By sheer sense of logic and maths (and bullshittery), as the SOMH subreddit has hit 50 members. 1000-50 is 950 so we only need to hit 950! *cries*"
109,"Jul 20, 2022",I was confident that we'll reach 1k when I looked at the comments earlier lmao
109,"Jul 20, 2022","don't the enforcers look like this ""villain"" from the movie home? like it was the armour of some star shaped alien who was rescuing his egg with little star aliens"
109,"Jul 20, 2022",I NEED MOROROROROROROEEEEEEEEE! ALSO DOKJA BE HITTIN DIFFERENT 
109,"Jul 20, 2022",FEAR ME DOKKAEBI! FOR I AM SETO KAIB...I mean...DOKJA KIM!
109,"Jul 20, 2022","At first my thoughts were about the streamers and viewers just like this chapter one side or the other just get out of hand with their actions or demands and because of that they ruined their work but that smile, that damn smile. "
109,"Jul 20, 2022","I sit just me, lr is this saying a lot about our online streamers on the 20 platforms we have?"
109,"Jul 20, 2022",dokkaebis are so cute lol
109,"Jul 20, 2022",THE MOST HATED CHARACTER
109,"Jul 20, 2022",enforcers: 🗿🗿 enforcers after dokja wants to have a private meeting: 👹👹

109,"Jul 20, 2022","[The Constellation . . . wants you to hit Paul once, for him. 500 coins has been donated.]"
109,"Jul 20, 2022","[the constellation Oravis Anum is currently throwing coins at the screen, cackling at the low level dokkeboy. 500 coins have been sponsored]"
109,"Jul 20, 2022","The enforcers look absolutely rad, yes, but also? their little nubbly legs make me chuckle I love them"
109,"Jul 20, 2022","""Oh? You're approaching? You're coming straight at me with the few measly coins that you have?"" *Dokja opens wallet* ""I can beat the shit out of you all day long"""
109,"Jul 20, 2022",this is probably my favorite chapter so far this is just great
109,"Jul 20, 2022",At the end I can’t help but look at the amount of coins he has and know that Paul is about to get the shit beaten out of him.
109,"Jul 20, 2022",Oh sweet sweet episode 
109,"Jul 20, 2022","HELL YEAH, GO MACHO ON HIM, DO THOSE WWE MOVES TOO BODY SLAM EM!!!"

109,"Jul 20, 2022","AM I THE ONLY ONE WHO WAS SO SATISFIED OF SEEING THAT D*MN MID GRADE DOKKAIBI BEING PUNCH, FLOWN AWAY AND HAVING HIS BLOODY FACE BUSTED ??"
109,"Jul 20, 2022",Paul: Why do I have a button with a red circle floating above my head? 
109,"Jul 20, 2022","Yes love, beat the shit out of Paul"
109,"Jul 20, 2022","'so, you can't beat him up, because you will be fined ' ""oh, you mean I have to pay some change to beat him? "" '... well yeah. go ahead'"
109,"Jul 20, 2022","And people say Money can't buy you happiness, BULL. This is My Serotonin "
109,"Jul 20, 2022","Even the enforcers are like ""Ah shit, dis gon be good"""
109,"Jul 20, 2022",Dokja really said: Money ain't a thing
109,"Jul 20, 2022",BEAT HIS ASS
109,"Jul 20, 2022","LMAO
Finally a good chapter. 
I dislike most but I'm too invested to stop. Also, the action is good so eh, why not."
109,"Jul 20, 2022",PAUL TALK TO ME 
109,"Jul 20, 2022","In all seriousness, this arc was so emotionally draining to read all at once but so so worth it (NOW i know the benefits of weekly updates <3), the art was as stunning as always and the plot was so immersive and this is and will never stop being one of my favourite series on WEBTOON."
109,"Jul 20, 2022",Sendai's One-Eyed Dragon = Date Masamune
109,"Jul 20, 2022",Dude be like: I can afford to kick your @$$ from here to the moon and back and still have money left over..... so lets get started. 😈

109,"Jul 20, 2022",Lesgooo
109,"Jul 20, 2022",KICK HIS ASS!!!!! TURN HIM INTO LAMBCHOPS!!!!!
109,"Jul 20, 2022","The guy merced his sort of-incarnation via a proxy and expected to be paid. The only payment he’s getting served is a knuckle sandwich. 

I’m kind of hoping that hits here work like the king death match where more money spent equals greater hit force. Paul would be much more pleasant as a fur carpet. 


"
109,"Jul 20, 2022",that look of uselessness and disgust gazing upon paul. it won't change anything but you'll be paying..heavily..slowly.
109,"Jul 20, 2022",Dokja Kim Current Balance: 𝖍𝖊𝖑𝖑𝖆 𝖇𝖗𝖊𝖆𝖉

109,"Jul 20, 2022","The enforcers sound like YouTube admins. ""We don't care it's what your subscribers wanted. *We* don't like it"""

109,"Jul 20, 2022","Dokja, your making my heart doki doki and badum badump"
109,"Jul 20, 2022","Time to sit back and watch the sweet, sweet show ~ 🍿 😈💆"

109,"Jul 20, 2022",Bro those enforcers knew what was going to happen lol
109,"Jul 20, 2022",emotionless dokja looks so scary

109,"Jul 20, 2022",he has coins to burn
109,"Jul 20, 2022",I love Paul's design but he's such an asshat. Its good he's getting his just desserts

109,"Jul 20, 2022",nice work
109,"Jul 20, 2022",i loved the kekeke the enforcers knew what was coming and they supported it.
109,"Jul 20, 2022","200k ÷ 500=??? 500 +500= 1000, 200 ×2= 400 so he can hit him 401 times but only has 20 minutes sounds like a carnival game fun when you are rich 😀"
109,"Jul 20, 2022",help what are the 3 promises?
109,"Jul 20, 2022","dokja, I hope you know I fully expect you to bi**h slap Paul. 100 times."

109,"Jul 20, 2022",I can already tell coffin dance is playing in the bg
109,"Jul 20, 2022","Taking how much Dokja has and dividing that by the 500 coins he is deducted each time he hits Paul (as someone named Paul this episode was SUPER meta), Dokja can hit the little sh*t about 411 times.Edit: Seeing how much Dokja can beat Paul, I now see why the Enforcers were having a wicked cackle."
109,"Jul 20, 2022",GRAB HIS DICK AND TWIST IT!! THE OOOOL’ DICK TWIST!

109,"Jun 27, 2022",I see we're keeping with the trend that everytime he opens his wallet someone's about to get fucked up
109,"Jun 22, 2022",this episode really got me. the look on his face? episodes like this keep Dokja grounded as a character for me it's so good
109,"Jun 15, 2022",Ok ☺️ But THE LAST PANEL🔥🔥🔥🔥

109,"Jun 15, 2022","ahhhhhh yes, an excellent can of whoop ass on the most annoying character in this story to date has been opened up. I await next week's episode with pleasure. "
109,"Jun 15, 2022",The enforcers saw his coins and knew he was about enforce a punishment onto Paul 
109,"Jun 15, 2022",Please let the entire next chapter just be him getting beat up

If someone did something that is too unlikely, then a “probability storm” might occur (a potentially lethal storm of sparks), or the offender would get punished in some other way. You can also use your own probability for others, lessening the amount they have to pay to make something happen. Comments have an example:"
