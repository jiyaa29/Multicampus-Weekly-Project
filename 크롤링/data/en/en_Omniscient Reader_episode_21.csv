21,"Oct 16, 2020","dokja is a good person for letting lil man stay naive and optimistic, if he isnt ready for the truth yet he will break instead of growing. also love the design of the warden he has some very awesome  love craftian vibes "

21,"Oct 16, 2020","I seriously thought Dokja was going to kill Mr Han there, and get rewarded by many constellations."
21,"Oct 16, 2020","dokja sees himself in gilyeong 😭😭 of course his advice would be choosing to be sheltered away from the truth & escape into hope, cause thats exactly what he did while reading ways of survival"
21,"Oct 16, 2020",The Obsessive Webtoon Reader has gifted you 5 coins.
21,"Nov 11, 2020","Kid: ""Are you a protagonist?""The protagonist of this story: ""No."""
21,"Oct 16, 2020",I hope that there is an anime of this at some point 
21,"Oct 16, 2020",Gilyeong best boi 
21,"Oct 16, 2020",I love how there are wholesome (yet very real) moments; like Gilyeong and Dokja!
21,"Oct 16, 2020",I'd be happy to see if Mr. Han gets some sort of redemption arc. At the same time I'm not saying I'd be sad if he were hit by a bus. 
21,"Oct 16, 2020","[The constellation ""Lazy Broke Weeb"" is excited to see your next action.] [5 coins have been sponsored.]"
21,"Oct 16, 2020",When I noticed that this episode is to be released in 61 days... I realized I will never have the patience to wait that long for a free new chapter. I'm at the point of no return. I will always buy coins for this
21,"Oct 16, 2020",constellation is sad that Dokja missed
21,"Nov 11, 2020","I wish Gilyoung still calls Dokja ""hyung"" in this translation but-- ah well"
21,"Oct 16, 2020","What a mad lad. Also, I would die for that child..."
21,"Nov 11, 2020",Dokja:I’m keeping this kid because he’s useful Me: you’ve adopted him as your son
21,"Oct 16, 2020",I have seen enough hentai to know where this is going

21,"Nov 6, 2020","Dokja and Gilyeong are so cute, I hope they stay as a team forever omg "

21,"Oct 16, 2020",*Dark souls boss music begins*
21,"Oct 16, 2020",I want to know what it’s saying lol
21,"Nov 11, 2020",I don't see Dokja as a bad guy for letting the kid stay optimistic even though he thinks he's a bad adult. It's clear he cares for the kid even though he tries to hide his emotions. His character is so simple yet so complex. Also the kid is freaking smart! I just really enjoy this WebToon. It's so well done! 
21,"Nov 11, 2020",I prefer Gilyeong to call Dokja as Hyung. Translator please keep the honorifics. 
21,"Oct 16, 2020","I’ve never been so obsessed with a webtoon, it’s insane. Please take all my money, my life, my kidneys ..."
21,"Nov 11, 2020",[A few constellations are beginning to tear up]... It's me. I'm constellations.

21,"Nov 11, 2020",When Dokja says he is not the protagonist [The Constellation Webtoon Readers laugh at you being naive] {you have been gifted 5 coins}
21,"Oct 16, 2020","so the kids power have the side affect of me talk damage if the bug dies but earlier it said that all light is absorbed into the black abyss but his ability gave off light meaning that either he can beat the monster or he is going to be helpful in beating it 
also that mr.han is worse than a child who is probly under the age of 13 "
21,"Nov 11, 2020","...Han is such a CREEP. He stole Sanga's bike to make her take a ride home with him, and when she didn't, he FOLLOWED HER TO THE SUBWAY??? Some characters really are made to be hated"
21,"Nov 11, 2020",Sun wukong(prisoner of the golden headband): GOD SOMEONE SHUT HIM UP. THANK YOU DOKJA HERE SOME COINS
21,"Nov 11, 2020",This is such a good adaptation I'm crying. I'm a huge fan of the novel and so far it did not disappoint at all. I always comment in the novel and I'm glad that people who read the webtoon are also checking out the novel. It's really great and is honestly one of the best with this kind of concept. Hope y'all stay with this till the end! Because it really is worth the wait :3
21,"Oct 16, 2020",[This Constellation is READY TO SPEND ALL HER COIN pls upload more 😩😩😩]
21,"Nov 11, 2020",the kid is so adorable 
21,"Nov 11, 2020",That ain't a Dark warden. That's a high ranking Dementor. 
21,"Nov 11, 2020",bruh when one of the watchers said they didn't like Mr. Han I was like me too bruh me too
21,"Nov 11, 2020",The irony of him saying he isn't the protagonist while being the protagonist of this story.
21,"Nov 11, 2020","bro, dokja and gilyoung holding hands tho— im so soft??"
21,"Nov 11, 2020",Gilyeong is such a good smart boi 
21,"Nov 11, 2020","This is one of my fav stories in here, and if you guys are interested of actually reading the web novel it self I would say go for it! It’s quite a lengthy read but it depends on your taste :)). Plus it’s kinda frustrating to not tell the contents of the story, but I won’t spoil. You could say I’m Kim dokja."
21,"Nov 11, 2020",Dojka indirectly said shut up when he threw the spike.
21,"Oct 16, 2020",A fee has been added to see the next episode 
21,"Nov 11, 2020",Dang it “gaaaw etur” isn’t working in google translate guys Edit: ok guys I found “gaaw etur” and in Hindi it means “village atur” which I think is a place in southwestern France
21,"Nov 6, 2020",I wish I found this series much later. waiting is killing me.
21,"Oct 16, 2020","I am pleased with these events, and have gifted you with 5 coins."
21,"Nov 13, 2020",petition to add honorifics to their names. because when gilyeong just says dokja without adding hyung just loses the intimacy 😭😭😭
21,"Nov 11, 2020","Interesting. Weve learnt 2 new things about the constellations If a group a of them fall under a category like ""the constellations of absolute good"" then if they all do something they'll be referred to that way. I think. Also the Secretive Plotter doesnt like being out of the loop. I'm actually really curious what's going on with Secretive Plotter. He sounds like he'd be a great sponser if he went all in on you but otherwise he'd be way too conservative. "
21,"Nov 11, 2020","""a few constellations are beginning to tear up"" oh no, they caught me 🥺🤣"
21,"Nov 11, 2020",Constellations of the absolute Good alignment? Who force billions to die in agony for their own petty amusement? Guys I think we found the endboss. And the reason that our hero refuses to align with any of them.
21,"Nov 11, 2020","it feels so weird to see gilyoung call dokja by his first name,, i really wish they’d used the honorifics :(("
21,"Nov 12, 2020",Dokja adopting Gilyoung 🤩
21,"Nov 11, 2020","I really wish the translator keep the honorifics, the other webtoons still keeping the honorifics then why Omniscient Reader can't?"
21,"Jul 11, 2021","Please just let the child survive as long as possible. Out of all the supporting characters, the kid has the keenest sense of awareness and just a lovable disposition. Especially when compared to most of the awful or dim-witted adults. "
21,"Feb 12, 2021","I love how the main character in this isn't a saint,but merely a normal perosn wanting to survive in a corrupted world. He's not perfect,and can be selfish,but so can everyone else."
21,"Nov 12, 2020","i really hope gilyeong won't betray dokja in the end or at least don't die pls, i really like that kid "
21,"Nov 11, 2020","Like the prisoner of the golden headband, we grow tired of the petty argument as well"
21,"Nov 11, 2020",I feel like prisoner of the golden headband is probably super friggin funny and chill
21,"Nov 11, 2020","i really how there are supreme beings who just watch you as entertainment but because they want to see your deeds, demonic judgment of fire and golden headband are my favs!"
21,"Nov 11, 2020",Gilyeong is so precious omg
21,"Nov 11, 2020",the constellations be acting like us readers
21,"Oct 16, 2020",This story is gonna make me broke
21,"Sep 15, 2021",a few of the constellations tear up. big relate with the constellationsDokja and Gilyeong's relationship is becoming so precious. I hope nth happens to the precious bean 😭
21,"Mar 17, 2021","The constellations are a whole mood especially the - ""Constellations are tearing up""  "
21,"Dec 6, 2020","your panels are probably the best I've seen in this format, you have really good pacing and the way you made the hole feel so completely dark was really foreboding and excellent. Genuinely adding a sense of dread for what was to come. I was hooked from episode 1 and am really looking forward to more :)"
21,"Nov 12, 2020","Oh, that's the first sign of actual emotion from Secret Plotter there, when it's revealed that Dokja is using everyone to get to the treasure trove...but he also knows that they'll be fine if he can get to them quickly so I'm more than fine with it, as long as they can all survive for longer! If Secret Plotter doesn't turn out to be an alternate timeline Dokja or another player from a previous timeline, I'll honestly be surprised."
21,"Nov 12, 2020","Gilyeong is my favorite character other than Dokja, but I like all of the characters surprisingly (well... not including Mr. Han..) but this is one of the few series where I actually love the mc. "
21,"Nov 11, 2020","WHY ISNT GILYOUNG CALLING DOKJA ""HYUNG/ELDER BROTHER""??!!! REALLY WISH THE TRANSLATOR WOULD READ THE WEBNOVEL TRANSLATIONS"
21,"Nov 11, 2020","The constellation [Obessed Procrastinating Teen] is gasping through the story. the constellation [Obessed Procrastinating Teen] is obsessed with the story and is procrastinating math to see what happens next. 
The constellation [Obessed Procrastinating Teen] wants to know if the little boy is 14 to 15 years of age, for research purposes, of course. "
21,"Nov 11, 2020",We are the constellations *cough cough* 
21,"Nov 11, 2020","I love the relationship between Gilyeong and Dokja, from the very beginning even if Dokja just wanted to team up with the kid in order to get points with the constellations, Gilyeong hold on to him in an adorable way and I just love to see whenever they interact no matter how small the moment is. "
21,"Nov 5, 2020","[ THE CONSTELLATION, TRUENEUTRALSPIRIT IS RESTLESS FOR MORE.][ YOU HAVE BEEN GIFTED 5 COINS.]"
21,"Nov 5, 2020",I was ready for the sub scenario from the constellations: We're sick of Mr. Han's shit. kill him.
21,"Oct 16, 2020",I love Gilyoung and Dokja’s relationship. It’s so precious. And when did they finally change Sanga to Sangah?? Did I just not notice? Thanks Webtoon. I wonder if there will be another coin event to catch up to simulcast 🤔
21,"Jul 28, 2021","i love all the constellations like they’re so amazing, dramatic, and funny. btw anyone knows what the warden was saying? oh and have a great day everyone! "
21,"Jul 22, 2021","""A few constellations are beginning to tear up.""
I have found my people 🙌"
21,"May 3, 2021",*warden shows up* me: IS THAT THE GRIM REAPER
21,"Nov 15, 2020",If the kid dies in this WEBTOON I will not hesitate to c r y
21,"Nov 12, 2020",Am i the only one who wanted Mr.Han to die or is it just me.
21,"Nov 11, 2020",Dokja has killed Mr Han Dokja has been awarded 1000000000000 coins for eliminating the most annoying person in the series
21,"Nov 11, 2020",CONSTELLATIONS ARE BEGINNING TO TEAR UP?!?! BAHAHA MEEEEEE
21,"Nov 11, 2020","oh my lord wtf is that lol, the kid is also my favorite he is cute :3"
21,"Nov 11, 2020", Can this be an anime please. 
21,"Nov 11, 2020",I swear if y’all kill off that kid- PLEASE DONT SPOIL!!
21,"Nov 11, 2020",honestly this is top tier s*it it is amazing to read. it fills you with anticipation for what's going to come next the characters are already amazing I hate some I love some I just have to ask what inspired you to make such exceptional work what drives you your motivation your passion?
21,"Nov 11, 2020",If anything happens to that kid I won't hesitate to throw hands 😤
21,"Nov 5, 2020",spending all my coins on this webtton 😙✌🏻
21,"Oct 16, 2020",Just being here early makes us constellations.
21,"Nov 11, 2020",the warden of the dark is kinda hot 🤐👁👄👁
21,"May 18, 2021",I can't tell if mr.Han is a rapist or just stupid. 🤔 I guess creepers gonna creep.
21,"Apr 29, 2021",omg we are rly the constellations 😂😂
21,"Apr 28, 2021",I was here for the coin raid but now I’m here to see it through. I love this whole concept. 
21,"Apr 16, 2021",I feel a deep connection for the constellation as they tear up at Guilyeong
21,"Apr 13, 2021",isn't it funny how rn we're like the constellations? watching it all play out and giving coins...
21,"Mar 19, 2021",Dude!!!! The character design looks so good!!
21,"Dec 25, 2020",doesnt gilyeong remind u of bam from tog
21,"Dec 24, 2020",could it be that Gilyeong is the few early readers of TWSA or perhaps he read other series. somehow Dokja will meet those other early TWSA readers as well?
21,"Dec 18, 2020",(the constellation demonic judge of fire despises myeongo han) bro same
21,"Dec 2, 2020",if the kid dies imma quit
21,"Nov 13, 2020",who else was hoping that dokja threw the needle at han...
21,"Nov 12, 2020",Dokja: the blade is bluntMe: the blade is melted....
21,"Nov 12, 2020","also again, webtoon translaters PLEASE keep the honorifics!!! removing it takes out the emotion of the characters. plus so many characters call dokja ""ahjussi"" and ""hyung"" its gonna be weird without it"
21,"Nov 12, 2020",i really cant believe Dokja was called the Ugliest King-_-
21,"Nov 12, 2020",I like this kid he has main character but never will be main character energy 
21,"Nov 12, 2020","God, when this will turn to anime?"
21,"Nov 12, 2020",im not sure if what im saying is actually tru but i truly think that that kid could handle the truth. kids arent weak to such information but instead remember they r more adaptive than adults. i think the kid would just get shocked for a while but slowly accept it. although im not saying that he shouldve shared the truth w him but rather saying that that kid may be willing to handle the info
21,"Nov 12, 2020",Thor: Dokja don't make the same mistake I did AIM FOR THE D#MN HEAD
21,"Nov 11, 2020","Damn he missed, should of aimed for the head "
21,"Nov 11, 2020","Still can't get over how they made Gilyoung-ie call KDJ 'Dokja' with no honorifics... That's his hyung... Also his question to KDJ 😳😳 SingShong once again, is so very smart"
21,"Nov 11, 2020",This comic is so stressful. I need to mr. Han to die already because he just adds so much stress and rage in me
21,"Nov 11, 2020","translator nim, please don't get rid of the honorific. I think it seems rude if gilyoung call dokja only by his name,since dokja much older than him. in the novel gilyoung always call dokja with ""hyung"" or ""Dokja Hyung"". and sangah too, it suppose ""sangah unni"". also the honorific-ssi, then ""noona"", ""ahjussi"", and the others. please add the honorific"
21,"Nov 11, 2020",[A FEW CONSTELLATIONS STARTED TO TEAR UP] ROFL!
21,"Nov 11, 2020","""I'm not the protagonist"" ah yes, LiEs aNd DecEiT"
21,"Jul 14, 2021","I’m a first time reader, so don’t judge me if I’m wrong, but what if the author was a regressor? What if the author purposefully started writing the original novel, and even continues writing it even if only Dokja read it, because he wanted to make sure that he was able to do something to save humanity? Maybe I’m just looking too far into it, but it’d be an interesting twist; finding out that the author knew what was going to happen, so he wrote the original novel."
21,"Jun 22, 2021",That kid is like the sweetest thing ever ☺️. He's so optimistic and a lovable character. I really hope he gets to the end of the story.
21,"Apr 29, 2021",i want the kid to survive.. and I want Dokja to adopt him.. is it too much to ask for? yes. Will I take my request back? no.. I can only dream 
21,"Apr 28, 2021",I was here just because of the coin raid but nahh man I'm not leaving anytime soon.
21,"Apr 16, 2021",I want Han to die no offense
21,"Apr 15, 2021",gilyeong omg He's so pure
21,"Apr 13, 2021","bro i have a sneaking suspicion that the kid is going to die, and if he does i'm crying myself to sleep ;;;-;"
21,"Mar 24, 2021",the constellations were tearing up 🤣🤣
21,"Mar 22, 2021",oh shit the grim reaper's friend is here
21,"Mar 22, 2021",warden of the dark?...No no that's ...        ✨slenderman in his bed wear✨
21,"Mar 19, 2021","don't mind me, im just building a ship 🚢🔨🙂 hyeonseong and huiwon are perfect for each other 🤗"
21,"Mar 17, 2021","if the child dies, we riot."
21,"Mar 14, 2021",im loving gilyoung so much
21,"Feb 14, 2021",The German language has become so popular that even monsters have started learning it
21,"Feb 9, 2021",WHY ARE ALL THE CHARACTERS SO DAMN LIKABLE
21,"Feb 3, 2021",gilyoung calling dokja by his name is so weird to me im just so used to him calling dokja his hyung 😭😭😭
21,"Feb 2, 2021",Myeongoh is a man who can't take no as an answer. and now he's blaming Sangah when he did all of that himself? scum
21,"Dec 3, 2020","this han bastard can go die. like wtf. i know so many people like him and they'll never admit what a terrible person they are. he stole her bike which is a crime,  because he wanted to drive her home probably because A-he thought they'd be closer B-he wanted to know where she lived and C-he's just a creep. instead of going home when she said no(because she didnt know him well and she was probably creeped out)he stalked her to the subway&he has the gall to blame her. he'd be dead if he was alone."
21,"Dec 2, 2020",We are the constellations 😂 
21,"Dec 1, 2020",I want a dokkaebi plushy so bad
21,"Nov 25, 2020",dude become his father when this freaking apocalypse is over 
21,"Nov 14, 2020",I was so into this comic that I went and started reading the webnovel and in less than a week I'm on chapter 233 and I have no regrets
21,"Nov 13, 2020","I genuinely can't get a read on Dokja. He's extremely pragmatic. I really like that he isn't your typical hero, but I'm concerned he'll leave his friends for dead if it suited him."
21,"Nov 12, 2020",Warden Of The Dark needs a Snickers. He ain't himself when he's hungry.
21,"Nov 12, 2020","I prefer ""Hyung"" for the kid to say, instead of ""Dokja"" like the novel. like that it can feel more the kid attitude towards the MC. Or at least please put ""big brother"" or explain what means ""hyung"" 🤔"
21,"Nov 12, 2020","Honestly, you should just let Mr. Han die. I can't believe he's blaming Sangah for getting them all in this mess just because she chose not to go with him."
21,"Nov 12, 2020",100% sure that Mr. Han's constelation is king of the small fries
21,"Nov 12, 2020",I love how the constellations react the same way us readers do
21,"Nov 12, 2020",I agree with everything that the constellations said in that episode.
21,"Nov 11, 2020",I'm so ready if this is going to be animated (*≧▽≦) 
21,"Nov 11, 2020","ok but if this webtoon turned into anime, it would be so popular "
21,"Nov 11, 2020",Can Demonic Judge of Fire please burn Myeongoh Han?
21,"Nov 11, 2020",I swear to god if Gilyoung dies I *will* throw hands
21,"Nov 11, 2020",I literally can’t put this down. It’s the highlight of my day when updated! This is well written and honestly well made overall. The art style is phenomenal and I appreciate the work you do 
21,"Nov 11, 2020",""" a few constellations are beginning to tear up "" lmao "
21,"Nov 11, 2020",I'm beginning to think I should change my username to prisoner of the golden headband.....
21,"Nov 11, 2020",I hope Dokja and thee kid become better friends. I wonder if/who his right-hand man is gonna be
21,"Nov 11, 2020","Yo, the caves and cliffs update is looking kinda nice."
21,"Sep 24, 2021",I think Mr. Han is past his expiration date. :)
21,"Sep 9, 2021",The fourth wall ability is basically just emotional suppression 😅
21,"Jul 28, 2021",The Constellations are also damn dramatic
21,"Apr 29, 2021",Damn I wanna adopt Gilyeong. He better stay until the end and Dokja must keep him 🥺
21,"Apr 29, 2021",If someone keeps rejecting your offer take the damn hint. Not think of ways to harass them till they give in...creep....perv...waste of skin
21,"Apr 28, 2021","e constellation demonic judge of fire, despises meongoh han... same man... same"
21,"Apr 27, 2021","""A few constellations are beginning to tear up"" HAHAHAHAHA!!!! The constellations are like us who get angry sad happy etc lmao😂😂😂 it's fun to connect with the constellations for some reason cuz we can agree that what the constellations feel we feel it too😂😂😂😂😂"
21,"Apr 13, 2021","Prisoner of the Golden Headband really is just us, isn't he?"
21,"Apr 12, 2021","i get naofumi vibes from dokja. he has a calm and chilly demeanor, but inside, he's a really kindhearted person. lmao u'll get what i mean if u watch the rising of the shield hero"
21,"Mar 31, 2021",the constellations are a mood 😂😂
21,"Mar 31, 2021","Gilyeong is quite possibly my favorite character of all time, I hope everything ends up okay for him 😭"

21,"Nov 16, 2020","reading comments is so dangerous. appreciate people putting spoiler warnings btw ily. Gilyeong is my favorite, he is just a really polite boi that energy fuels me, adorable--I just want to give him a head pat, I want to siphon all my funds into his account--"
21,"Nov 14, 2020","Wtf, gilyoung really did call dokja ""dokja"" here wtf wtf. I already contacted webtoon team to somehow fix this, if you have time please do it too :(((( our sweet lil gilyoung calling his dokja hyung by the name just doesn't sit right with me. i hate this"
21,"Nov 14, 2020"," ""Bro, are you the MC?"" ""Nah.""
 ""Damn, dude."""
21,"Nov 13, 2020",So... Google Translate doesn't have a demon option.
21,"Nov 12, 2020","I'm amazed as heck. After reading the novel[Don't worry I don't like spoilers so I won't spoil what happens],I am amazed seeing how nothing changed too much and I'm excited to see new chapters!! Like bro,the novel is effing long!"
21,"Nov 12, 2020",Fourth wall is really important but will it be a permanent skill or ability to dokja? just wondering (Okay they said it stays for eternity im glad🥰)
21,"Nov 12, 2020",I think we only keep Mr. Han as living bait. And Dokja was nice enough I think to let Gilyeong stay optimistic as sometimes I think people need it.
21,"Nov 12, 2020",wow ahaha and wow againg to the kid he is sharp 
21,"Nov 12, 2020","Translation: IMMA KILL YOU, BOI"
21,"Nov 12, 2020","Ohey, it's Slenderman's cousin."
21,"Nov 12, 2020",Why do I like the kid more than the actual adults? (Except for Dojka and the women he saved)
21,"Nov 12, 2020","if I was a constellation, I keep watching their channel bruh"
21,"Nov 11, 2020","Ohhhh my God, Mr. Han is a ""nice guy."" I thought he was a pretentious prick, but no he's even worse."
21,"Nov 11, 2020","""A few constellations are beginning to tear up.""Me: lowkey same 😭"
21,"Nov 11, 2020",I love how easily these characters bond with the omnicient reader and trust him yet none is entirely dependent upon him for their survival.(p.s.- I hope the next task is to eradicate Mr. Han from all scenarios of this webtoon)
21,"Nov 11, 2020",ngl dokja's ability fourth wall is really op
21,"Nov 11, 2020","Don't worry guys Mr. Han will get what's coming for him in the next few chapters 
also I am kinda worried for people who think the demon is hot "
21,"Nov 11, 2020",Dokja: I don’t like protagonist(Also Dokja: is protagonist of omniscient reader) 
21,"Nov 11, 2020",I just really want to see Kim Dokja in his white coat. 
21,"Feb 5, 2022",Why do I feel like we will fall in love with this kid only to have him killed later on 😭
21,"Jan 11, 2022","I think had a realisation, did the author call that power ""the fourth wall"" because he was once a reader and is now interacting with the story which is called ""breaking the fourth wall"" and it blocks all power from the story since he is the ""reader"" so the threats and stuff from the story can't harm him because of that isn't it. Please tell me that makes sense or am I going crazy"
21,"Oct 30, 2021",Mr. Han is the type of guy who says m'lady then calls u a sl*t for rejecting him
21,"Sep 20, 2021",You call constantly asking to give her a ride home not making a move on her seriously on top of that you stole her bike to do the same thing how much of a hypocrite is this guy? Can he just die already?
21,"Sep 2, 2021",always that one annoying ass character in apocalypse scenarios 💀
21,"Aug 25, 2021",Heh I knew it. Mr Han stole Sangah's bike and was on that subway to try and get with her. Thirsty dude wanted to clap those cheeks and thinks her riding home with him would have changed their current predicament of the apocalypse. What a moron. Being on the subway is the only reason he's currently alive 😂
21,"Aug 14, 2021",that han dude is so disgusting 
21,"Aug 12, 2021",I think the constellations commentary is my favorite part💕🤣
21,"Aug 12, 2021",*throws a spear right next to his face* “A few constellations are pleased.”

21,"Apr 29, 2021","I don't know why but I think that this kid, Gilyoung is going to die. But I wish he wouldn't."
21,"Apr 29, 2021",its so cute that gilyoung is holding dokja's hand like that 😳
21,"Apr 29, 2021",Imagine if we could actually reward characters in webcomics for fucking with other characters that we hate 😂
21,"Apr 28, 2021",these constellations have me weakkkkk💀
21,"Apr 28, 2021",Prisoner of the golden headband is us readers

21,"Feb 12, 2021","I just love how is the reader and the constellation agree and think the same way 😂😂 anytime an update in a constellation shows up, I’m just like “yup me too”"
21,"Jan 31, 2021",I like dokja’s unbothered expressions 
21,"Jan 28, 2021","dokja is such an interesting mc... on one hand, he's almost narcissistic in the way he knows how the game works, but he's also not completely letting go of his morals and has some kind of vague hope that the story will change even though he knows how it ends! its so interesting i cant stop reading"
21,"Jan 20, 2021",I so feel the golden headband constellation's reactions lol
21,"Jan 4, 2021",prisoner of the golden headband is a total crackhead
21,"Dec 1, 2020","I have burst out laughing multiple times every chapter, and every time it’s because of those damn constellations 😂"
21,"Nov 28, 2020",Dokja (after Gilyoung says he believes in him): I don't get what he sees in me.Me: He sees exactly what you refuse to see in yourself - selflessness..
21,"Nov 24, 2020",I’m loving the relationship between Dokja and the kid
21,"Nov 20, 2020",I love that little boy and nothing better happen to him or I will be sad
21,"Nov 20, 2020","""the consellations have started to tear up"" YEAH ME TOO"
21,"Nov 15, 2020","For those who absolutely can’t wait to learn what happens next, read the completed story (it has the same name) on Webnovel! It’s such a cool experience to read the full storyline and then go back and see the art for it. Trust me, you won’t regret it!"
21,"Nov 14, 2020",This is the kind of action packed webtoon I would really love to see as an anime! Not that the ones that have recently been adapted aren't good in their own way but... man this just hits different in the best way. I love it. 
21,"Nov 13, 2020","I’m so glad gilyeoung can show his skills! And wait for Sanga to show her skills :) Also, I cannot wait for ep 28, and 29 when yjh finds out our Mc is still alive, haha "
21,"Nov 13, 2020",really hope everyone checks out the novel. it's truly amazing !!!
21,"Nov 13, 2020","In this chapter, we have almost everything: overshadowing, hmo being an asshole, relate in a spiritual level with swk, kdj's first lie (no, lhs. He will never call for help if something happens to him), mental trauma, and cliffhanger! Up next, hmo will learn the meaning of creation! "
21,"Nov 13, 2020",wait- did they cut out the word hyung? pls dont tell they did im-😿
21,"Nov 12, 2020","I'm not sure but 'interspecies communication' doesn't sound half as good as the ability from the light novel I read it was called 'Diverse Communication' which a lot cooler, it's the same ability that shin yoosung and Lee giliyoung use but it just sounds better!
"
21,"Nov 12, 2020","""The effect of fear was canceled by the Gamer's Mind"""
21,"Nov 12, 2020",{The 4th wall has nullified some of the fear} no shit. that looks FUCKING scary
21,"Nov 12, 2020","I really hope he can protect the Child, maybe he is what can keep him from losing all the hope and faith in humanity"
21,"Nov 12, 2020","Realize that the move was ""Fourth Wall"", WE SAVED DOKJA OMG (we referring to readers)"
21,"Nov 11, 2020",Dokja may seem cruel at times but really he is doing what he thinks is best for the others... and maybe also to get rid of people like mt. Han lmaooo.
21,"Nov 11, 2020",You will relook to this chapter again after one year or less and you will see this comment and ask yourself how.
21,"Nov 11, 2020",YOOO THIS GETTING AN ANIMATED SERIOUS WOULD BE INCREDIBLE
21,"Nov 11, 2020",I sometimes think Dokja keeps Meongwhatshisname to have either as an honorable sacrifice at later levels or as a potential ally in case he changes his heart after a while. I’m still voting fishbait until further character development
21,"Nov 11, 2020",At this point why bother hunting monsters when you can just eat Mr Han? Like bruh kill him already nobody's gonna miss him
21,"Nov 11, 2020","Gilyoung is an greatly written character hes both smart AND child like,  a combination I dont see a lot in smart kid characters "
21,"Nov 11, 2020",its relatable for the protagonist to think that he is a bad grown up for letting the kid stay optimistic... But he isn’t entirely. There are far worse things you could do to make you a bad grown up. just sayin. 🤷🏻‍♀️
21,"Nov 11, 2020",How can this not already be a anime??
21,"Nov 11, 2020","CREATOR IS A GENIUS!!! This really couldn't be better, I've never wanted coins so much in my life!!"

21,"Nov 11, 2020",That little boy is so precious 🥰
21,"Nov 11, 2020",2 things. 1) I like that the kid is smart but still naive can't wait to see how he grows. 2) what a pathetic douchebag that guy is
21,"Oct 18, 2020","Kinda miffed at the fact that Webtoon refuses to use the term “Hyung/Hyeong” that Gilyeong supposedly calls Dokja and not his name. I know this is supposed to be an English equivalent but we all know this is originally Korean. We could have kept some of their culture like the calling of Hyung and Noona to someone older and learn to adapt to the terms instead. Some official English translations keep them as well, so why can’t Webtoon."
21,"Oct 16, 2020",Warden of the Dark: FEAR ME!Dokja: 😐...Im just a reader...so not that scary...
21,"Oct 16, 2020","「The constellation, prisoner of the golden headband」is really into this... 😂 nothing like a petty argument to be annoyed by 🤦🏻‍♂️"
21,"Nov 12, 2020",I hereby create the Gilyeong Gang
21,"Sep 23, 2022","the way dokja acts in these situations makes me think he's not seeing any of the people around him as humans, but more like temporary people around him, its irritating to see how he treats the little kid honestly "
21,"Sep 4, 2022",the constellation's reaction are best hahaha
21,"Apr 17, 2022","i realized that all those ""constellations"" actually represents the readers POV"
21,"Oct 29, 2021",THAT KID SOLVED A MYSTERY THE PROTAGONIST DIDNT 
21,"Oct 7, 2021",I really like dokja and gillys relationship a father son kinda relationship it’s quite rare to see in stories like this.

21,"Aug 27, 2021",prisoner of the golden headband is all of us. their reaction is 👌
21,"Aug 25, 2021",A few constellations have started to tear up. You were gifted 200 coins. And Dokja's plan of saving Gilyoung is paying off. He knew taking him in and training him would allow him to gain a potentially strong loyal ally and curry him favor from the constellations for some sweet sweet coins. He also did it subconsciously because he's still a good person after all. 
21,"Aug 20, 2021",a few constellations started to tear up lol
21,"Aug 17, 2021",can they kill han already damn 😒

21,"May 1, 2021",If the kid dies I know this fandom is gonna lose it ☹️😭
21,"May 1, 2021",that 4th wall is definitely coming in handy
21,"May 1, 2021",I'VE ONLY KNOWN THE KIDDO FOR TWO HOURS (I started the webtoon two hours ago) BUT I SWEAR THAT IF SOMETHING HAPPENS TO HIM I'LL KILL EVERYONE IN THIS ROOM AND THEN KILL MYSELF
21,"May 1, 2021",Just realized what his attribute fourth wall his because sometimes in webtoons a character breaks the fourth wall and well he read the story so he is constantly breaking the fourth wall in that webtoon (correct me if I’m wrong) 😅
21,"May 1, 2021",The constellations are tearing up OMG🥺🥺🥺
21,"Apr 30, 2021",poor kid. He literally heard and felt all those insects at their last momen

21,"Feb 26, 2021",im so hooked on this. i really like how dokja character gets him to explain the plot and story smoothly. plus the attributes and skills similar like other action type webtoons like the gamer and dice or TOG really got enhanced w the constellations actions.

21,"Apr 26, 2021",Where are my free coins 🤠
21,"Apr 26, 2021","I think the fourth wall is a skill that exists just because dokja used to be a reader of the novel. Like there used to exist a ""fourth wall"" between the reader and the novel, and that ""fourth wall"" persists even now but in reality"
21,"Apr 24, 2021",I can't get enough how some constellations despises or grown tired of Mr. Han 
21,"Apr 14, 2021",Kamun de etur! Gaaaww etur!!!!!!!
21,"Apr 11, 2021",I'd definitely be the first constellation to reward him for killing Mr Han
21,"Apr 5, 2021","alr grim reaper, get it ig :>"
21,"Apr 4, 2021","In dokja's position I would have tried playing it all off. especially with the kid, because as someone who it very aware of their ignorance I'd rather have the truth even if it hurts. I think dokja should have responded in a way that implies that he believes there is a reward at the end but is unsure of it, no child wants to be treated like they just couldn't understand. just my view on his choices I'm sure what he did will be helpful to the plot later on though"
21,"Apr 2, 2021",i thought mr. Han is ded. I want to get rid of him 😸 when will he die 😅 jk jk jk
21,"Mar 31, 2021",im tearing up with the constellations.. how can gilyeong be so adorable?! hes already my favorite charater

Looks like they've arrived at the treasure... and the boss as well. I didn't expect a giant tentacle boss on a rat's lair though. How will Dokja deal with this Dark Warden? What kind of skills will he use?"

21,"Feb 18, 2021",These constellations are soft-hearted haha I find it funny the way they always react whenever Dokja do or will say something lmao 'a few constellation are beginning to tear up' 😂 
21,"Jan 28, 2021",Mr Han is one of those characters in stories whose only purpose is comedy relief or being a waste of space disposable character.
21,"Jan 24, 2021",Omg i can't. I need my sweet gilyoung to call dokja as hyung 😭😭😭
21,"Jan 18, 2021",we all teared up didn't we?
21,"Jan 10, 2021","Kim Dokja will never consider himself as a protagonist despite how much he wishes to be one. He considers himself as a reader and chooses to stay in that role and let the protag do what he wants. Well, that's why I personally call him MC while Yu Junghyeok the protag, they usually have the same meaning except in this series, they have quite a difference."
