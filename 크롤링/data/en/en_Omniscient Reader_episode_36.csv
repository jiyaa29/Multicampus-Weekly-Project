Episode,Date,Review
36,"Jan 6, 2021","Lol Dokja: “May the Odds be Ever in Your Favor” 
Everyone else: “F*CK!!!” "
36,"Jan 6, 2021","the Dokkadebi freaking out is literally how I feel everytime Dokja gets a new plan, I know it'll work out but I can't help but panic a little "
36,"Jan 6, 2021",Nonchalant as always Dokja
36,"Jan 6, 2021",I really like Dokja's character. He can think of solutions quickly and is merciless to those who he considers bad guys
36,"Jan 9, 2021","Gilyeong’s loyalty is unsurpassed, honestly. Not only is he willing to kill if Dokja agrees, he offered to be left behind so Dokja could survive, he turned down Junghyeuk’s offer to join him so that he could stay with Dokja, and he growled at the man who showed interest in the bounty against Dokja. He’s genuinely so sweet."
36,"Jan 6, 2021",Constellation Eyes waiting for Tuesday night. We all got called out by the author and I love it! XD
36,"Jan 6, 2021",I love how dokja is the good and bad guy at the same time
36,"Jan 6, 2021",RIP Dokja’s ears.
36,"Jan 6, 2021","hippity hoppity, say goodbye to your property "
36,"Jan 7, 2021","[The constellations of channel #BIR-3642 have put out a hit on Dokja Kim]
Dokja: “Lol that’s cute” "
36,"Jan 6, 2021",I can’t wait for the next episode. Dokja is so crafty. He knows exactly how to mind bend people 🤣🤣
36,"Jan 6, 2021",I love the recurring theme of Dokja and the gang destroying selfish and greedy people by exposing them. I wish it were that easy in real life.
36,"Jan 31, 2021",Did anyone else notice gilyeong immediately sitting down as soon as dokja did? That kid seriously trusts him I want to give him a hug
36,"Jan 6, 2021","Dokja just laying down the harsh truth of the apocalypse, those people just werent lucky and so they get the harshest of the harshness."
36,"Jan 6, 2021",So did you guys read the other constellation names “eyes waiting for Tuesday night” and the other about an economics student?
36,"Jan 6, 2021",I can't wait to see how Dokja explains how he knows all of this information
36,"Jan 6, 2021",Gotta appreciate how petty and savage Dokja is. 
36,"Jan 7, 2021",did anyone realized that gilyong is growing at the guy who wanted to attack dokja absolutely adorable!!!!
36,"Jan 6, 2021","I love that he can use the abilities of established characters and has also been cultivating his own, I wonder if he can use the new protagonist abilities of his group that were not in the initial TWAS. I also am curious to see if he ever pulls out the mountain punch and goes full All-might and just destroys someone heh good on dohkja"
36,"Jan 6, 2021","Dokja: ""You're Lucky you see with me"". I Have the best Plot Armor. Hahaha"
36,"Jan 6, 2021",Dokja just chilling with some metaphorical popcorn
36,"Jan 6, 2021","The Studio Redice is doing a great job , my favorite Webtoon. "
36,"Jan 6, 2021",I wonder if a Dokkaebi can have a heart attack? 🤔 We may find out at this rate. 
36,"Feb 24, 2021","If I do the calculations then this comic will take over 10 years to complete since we’ve only read a little over 30 and we get 1 chapter a week for a story that has 551 chapters. Hope y’all are ready for the wait though the story is good, it just will a take a while."
36,"Jan 6, 2021",Anyone see the message “eyes waiting for Tuesday night”? That’s everyone here!!! 
36,"Feb 24, 2021","I really appreciate the presence the women have in this series. Their characters are complex, strong, and interesting. I’m all here for it 🙌"
36,"Jan 6, 2021","man i love the way he uses his knowledge to the fullest, so cunning"
36,"Jan 6, 2021",hahahahaha this is great. the constellation [Hypicratic Dragon] smiles and nods in approval at what has transpired. you have been gifted 5 coins
36,"Jan 6, 2021","Dokja really be using a rip off of the sharingan with limits, he was able to use talk no jutsu "
36,"Jan 6, 2021",Dokja seems like such an underestimated hero. love it!  
36,"Feb 24, 2021",Other Protags: Come with me if you want to live! Dokja: lol bye losers
36,"Jan 7, 2021",F**k it's impossible not to fast pass this comic. I would pay all the coins for the whole thing if possible. 
36,"Feb 24, 2021","honestly I love how Dokja isn't the usual main protagonist you know the ones ""We can save everyone if we put our spirit to it"" and ""I can win this if I believe in myself"", Dokja is like an actual person who will save his friends but not anyone else unless he needs to use them"
36,"Feb 25, 2021","Ironically, Huiwon would get more than 20000 coins for killing Dokja since you get all coins they own and Dokja has over 20000."
36,"Feb 24, 2021",Damn this turned from a comic where dokja tries to survive to a comic where dokja tries to have as much fun in the apocalypse as possible 
36,"Feb 24, 2021",Gilyeong literally GROWLING at the guy for thinking about attacking Dokja is the cutest
36,"Feb 24, 2021","""I guess they weren't so lucky"" and WHOSE FAULT IS THAT DOKJA "
36,"Jan 20, 2021",It’s lee gilyoungs angry face when and hung heewons judgmental face at the guy who wanted to kill dokja for me
36,"Feb 24, 2021",my favorite morally questionable protag
36,"Feb 24, 2021","Dokja's use of his skills and knowledge never ceases to amaze me. I think I'm especially happy because he's not a one dimensional ""hero"" he has his own personal selfishness as well "
36,"Feb 24, 2021","*Monsters rampaging, people being brutally murdered and just pure chaos* Dokja: Naptime anyone?"
36,"Feb 24, 2021",Can we just appreciate the fact that Gilyeong just growled at the guy who wanted to take the bounty scenario's rewards but it already expired? 
36,"Feb 24, 2021",Dokja is such an ass but he does it so charismatically 😂
36,"Feb 24, 2021",Dokja being petty and savage gives me a reason to live
36,"Feb 24, 2021",“secluded economics student” boi-
36,"Jan 9, 2021",damn this would be a sick anime
36,"Jan 6, 2021",WHAT DID MY CONSTELLATION SAY?? OH HO HO YOU THINK I DIDN’T MISS THAT LITTLE “waiting on friday night” CONSTELLATION NOTIF. WHY LEAVE US HANGIN MAN.
36,"Feb 25, 2021","Dokja is the true grey neutral of the story! its so refreshing to see someone whose morals are neither strictly good or bad, I love how quick he is to think of a plan. I also really love the whole concept i cant wait to see how the rest will play out"
36,"Feb 25, 2021",I would love to see this webtoon have an anime adaptation. Only if they don't ruin it
36,"Feb 24, 2021","For those who wonder why they saved that man, it was to decrease the bloodshed (it was the deal that Dokja made with Jihye), it was not for charity or that the man is useful."
36,"Feb 24, 2021",Gilyeong mimicking Dokja is so cute 
36,"Feb 24, 2021",Lmao Dokja is like a Dokkaebi disguised as a human trying to cause chaos for everybody
36,"Feb 24, 2021","I really love dokja's grey morality. He's pretty ruthless to people he doesn't care about but at the same time has the sense to give them at least a chance to stay alive, although it doesn't seem like he really cares about the final outcome."
36,"Jan 6, 2021",Bro this man has gone from some guy who read a lot to a calculating badass who isn't scared to do what he needs to survive. I like it
36,"Feb 24, 2021",Dokja: *does anything* Everyone else: What are you doing?! Dokkaebi: Why are you like this?!
36,"Feb 24, 2021","dokja""I think I did well"" *explosions and screaming in the distance* "
36,"Feb 24, 2021",are we sure dokja is not a lawyer
36,"Feb 25, 2021",I REALLY LIKE DOKJA!!!! I like this style of MC 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
36,"Feb 25, 2021","I love how Dokja is a morally grey character. He tries to do good, but when it comes to it, he won't hesitate to kill or do something questionable to survive."
36,"Feb 25, 2021",This would make a great anime you should make this into an anime or ask someone to do it
36,"Feb 25, 2021",He really said Fu*k you I’m not fighting but I can help you survive by telling you who to rely on for a bit
36,"Feb 24, 2021",I'm so gay for Jihye
36,"Feb 25, 2021","“Yoo Sangah-ssi.”“Yes. Please leave it to me.”
I didn’t need to explain it. Yoo Sangah already understood what she needed to do.
Her Binding Thread stretched out and started to rescue the people who couldn’t fight anymore. In any case, their mission was to buy time for Gong Pildu to deploy Armed Zone. (taken from the novel for those wondering abt that one random dude)"
36,"Feb 24, 2021","it's only ""fair"" if everyone have no rooms. With the same threat, it's truly survival at its best. They need to stick together, if they want more people to survive. Smart logic, Dokja"
36,"Feb 24, 2021",Dokja is such a bastard and I love him for it 
36,"Feb 24, 2021","lol at the contellation ""secluded economics student"". Why are you here? go back doing your homework and stop watching streams!!"
36,"Feb 24, 2021",Casually has his ears explode 
36,"Feb 25, 2021",his bastard energy is in top shape today. i love that for him
36,"Feb 24, 2021","why does Constellation ""Eyes Waiting for Tuesday Night"" sound familiar? :P"
36,"Feb 24, 2021","bruh if you just see the thumbnail dokja's face is like: hey, there are monsters about to kill is all? oh well, moving on,-"
36,"Feb 24, 2021","Gillyeong growling. That's it, that's the comment."
36,"Jul 10, 2021",Everybody else freaking out Dokja: “It be like that sometimes”
36,"Mar 9, 2021",i was on ep 1 yesterday.
36,"Mar 1, 2021","People shipping Dokja with Sangah, Hyunsung, Huiwon, Jonghyuk. . . . . . when we all know the real ship is Dokja x Pebble."
36,"Feb 25, 2021",well sucks to be pildu and his gang... also i love it when the constellations are so interested in the shenanigans dokja pull and bihyeong just starts panicking 
36,"Feb 24, 2021",Dokja low-key be like: I'll help you temporarily but every man for themself.
36,"Feb 24, 2021",Dokja: lol yall should've been nice to me the first time
36,"Feb 24, 2021",Everyone Else: But... those people will die!Dokja: Uhuh. I fail to see your point.
36,"Feb 24, 2021",Dokja's attitude gets me everytime
36,"Feb 24, 2021",I love this guy and his shenanigans
36,"Feb 24, 2021","O kid I’ve said it before but I can’t stress enough how I love that Dokja isn’t one one of those “I can’t sacrifice my morals, I gotta save everyone”. He’s not a bad guy, he just knows what he has to do to survive, and to me that makes him more human"
36,"May 10, 2021","Did no one else see the message, ""The constellation, Secluded Economics Student is excited by the destruction."""
36,"Mar 8, 2021",The likes are going down drastically so hear me out... Let's say this story is going to come real for us like it did for Dokja and only the consistent readers who read till the end will be prepared... Just some food for thought.
36,"Mar 2, 2021","dokjas plan was smart, but i’m a lil bitter bc i would be one of the people who died as a result of it lol"
36,"Feb 25, 2021","LMFAO if u zoom in when Dokja is getting messages from constellations, one of them is ""Eyes Waiting For Tuesday Night"" 😭😭"
36,"Feb 25, 2021",Wonder who the rando he had Sangah snatch up is? He certainly didn't do that for no reason.
36,"Feb 25, 2021", i love dokja hes the main character but he's not a hero nor a villain he just kinda does his own thing
36,"Feb 24, 2021",Dokja really do be one of the best mc’s ive ever read
36,"Jul 30, 2021",se-secluded economics student? that's the name of a constellation 💀
36,"Jul 21, 2021","Dokja manages a level of chill in life threatening, apocalyptic situations that I can't even achieve in everyday life. what an icon, honestly"
36,"Mar 6, 2021","Dokja is such a realist in a way that is good and kind but knows when to be cruel, what a character and i love him"
36,"Mar 1, 2021","'the constellation, secluded economics student, is excited by the destruction' yes!"
36,"Feb 27, 2021",Gilyoung growling at the dude for even thinking about laying a finder in Dokja 😂😂😂
36,"Feb 26, 2021",this needs to be turn into a anime
36,"Feb 26, 2021",Why is noone talking about the fact that Gilyoung GROWLED at the guy who was disappointed about the Dokja's bounty!!!!!
36,"Feb 26, 2021",How does the author even come up with a great storyline like this? Plus the art PROFESSIONAL. i love this webtoon so much
36,"Feb 26, 2021","Dokja: I offer Pildu as tribute!!!Pildu (from far away): F**k YOU, man!!!
Dokja: Lol"
36,"Feb 26, 2021",I like the constellation secluded economics student 
36,"Feb 25, 2021","well we are in the webtoon now ""Eyes waiting for Tuesday night"""
36,"Feb 24, 2021","The constellation ""Eyes waiting for Tuesday night""? damn author, way to call us all outXD"
36,"Feb 24, 2021","Everyone in the comments is just simping over Dokja lol. I don't think Pildu will die here tho cause Dokja introduced him as a really strong person. Also, where's Jungeyok.... the main protagonist guy Idk the name properly "
36,"Feb 24, 2021","Kim Dokja, you and your beautiful grin, bastard"
36,"Feb 24, 2021",there is a constellation called secluded economics student? moof.
36,"Feb 24, 2021",I love the webtoon fan constellations lmao 
36,"Jan 6, 2021",killing Dokja is a level C difficulty 😏
36,"Jun 13, 2021",I love how gilyeong straight up growled at the dude who showed interest in dokjas bounty 😂 
36,"May 10, 2021",DOKJA IS SO GORGEOUS ITS NOT EVEN FUNNY
36,"May 8, 2021",Are we just gonna ignore how gilyeong got mad at the people he looked cute 
36,"Apr 28, 2021","love how gilyeong went ""GRRR""🤬 at that guy who was after dokja "
36,"Mar 6, 2021",Dokja: So I got this new anime plot—
36,"Feb 27, 2021",When will this become an anime!!!😱
36,"Feb 25, 2021","Isn't that interesting, it almost seems like pildu was forced to become a good guy, even for just that moment"
36,"Feb 25, 2021","“The constellation Secluded Economics Student is excited by the destruction” That had me in tears🤣 There also, “The constellation Eyes Waiting for Thursday Night”"
36,"Feb 25, 2021",Why did he save that one dude I wonder?
36,"Feb 25, 2021",Dokja looks really pretty when he’a smug
36,"Feb 24, 2021"," This is just top notch story boarding, writing, idea, everything. a serious master piece 👌"
36,"Feb 24, 2021",How cunning...borderline villainous too
36,"Feb 24, 2021",Sooo like is it just me or like Dokja like super handsome😅
36,"Feb 24, 2021","Ahh I literally just finished reading the novel yesterday, and now I'm feeling the same anticipation and suspense from before, even though I know what's going to happen. I can't wait to relive this incredible novel again, especially when they draw out later chapters!"
36,"Feb 24, 2021",This comic is really about Dokja the Con Artist not Dokja the Reader 😂😂
36,"Feb 24, 2021",At this point dokja is just having fun rather than surviving 
36,"Oct 13, 2021",a constellation called secluded economics student LMAOOOO
36,"Aug 26, 2021","Gilyeong's even mimicking the way Dokja's sitting. Damn, he must really admire him."
36,"Apr 26, 2021",Sometimes Dokja really scares me  
36,"Mar 4, 2021","Did anyone else notice how Hyeonsong's attribute changed to ""The man who regained a sense of justice""?"
36,"Mar 2, 2021",Dokja sure is cruel lmao. I'm loving it for now at least
36,"Feb 27, 2021",I am mad bcs this isnt a anime :) I WOULD BE DEFINITELY AWESOME
36,"Feb 26, 2021",My wish is be as chill as Dokja is around chaos. My guy is the definition of zen ft
36,"Feb 25, 2021","This FREAKING GUY... Dokja, you're a diabolical MONSTER. **I LOVE IT!**"
36,"Feb 25, 2021",Wukong just vibing with the chaos.
36,"Feb 25, 2021",I have to say anyone who reads the locked chapters and then rereads them when they become free are literally... OMNISCIENT READERS.
36,"Feb 25, 2021","i just love how dokja isnt a character about morals or “right things to do”. no, he is about survival and being the smartest. i love it "
36,"Feb 25, 2021",*The constellation distracted highschool student is laughing at the chaos*

36,"Feb 24, 2021","Damn man, I freaking love Dokja. And I love his attributes, especially the bookmark one. And his plan to survive the Bounty was very friggin cunning. #DokjaistheBestProtagonist."

36,"Feb 24, 2021",Gilyeon’s growl was the cutest!!! 
36,"Feb 24, 2021","Dokja refusing Jihye's help like ""these hoes got nothing on me""... and he'd be right. He's so sly it's almost hilarious at this point"
36,"Feb 24, 2021",Dokja is the ultimate conman
36,"Feb 24, 2021","dokja is one heck of a manipulative bastard 😂 but honestly, without him, I don't think the story would even have such an interesting progress."
36,"Feb 24, 2021",Dokja you little troublemaker. 😂
36,"Feb 24, 2021","I think it’s so interesting because from the reader’s perspective I feel so calm, but just imaging what it would’ve been like for them in that scenario, it must have been horrible hahaha I’d panic"
36,"Feb 24, 2021","""The eyes waiting for Tuesday night?"" I think the author just called us out"
36,"Feb 24, 2021","Are the likes reducing....!?Why are the likes reducing... it's an amazing episode, just like the episode👍"

36,"Feb 24, 2021","I just gotta say, Dokja in that black button-up shirt is so friggin' HOT 🔥🥵😍 Literally, he's like Itachi Uchiha, or Levi Ackerman, or something. All he has to do is just...you know, stand there...staring..... *dreamy sigh, fanning herself*"
36,"Feb 24, 2021","Please dokkaebi, his ears explode blood 😂"

36,"Jan 6, 2021",Why there are people who dislike ALL the comments? just why? That's so childish. Seriously...
36,"Feb 24, 2021","Dokja is so cool, has the best personality I've ever seen on a webtoon character. He's also as efficient and smart as Dio (anime character)."

36,"Jul 29, 2021",gilyeong best child lmao
36,"Jul 23, 2021",i really love that there is a constellation named “secluded economics student”
36,"Jun 9, 2021",i like how he's not trying to save everyone lol
36,"Jun 6, 2021",Gilyeong copying dokja when he sat down is just so adorable istg 😩
36,"May 12, 2021",dokja is as bad  as rest of them. most people love him becauae he is very  cunning and brilliant but thats all because he has already read twsa and he is aware of what will happen. he has the upperhand in all situations. most  of his actions are down right cruel. but thats how their world is. its indeed survival of the fittest. dokja is the lesser evil among all the bad guys. and of course the story  is from his point of view. ao we all tend to sympathise with him a lot too. 
36,"May 6, 2021",what the FuDCk is Kim Dokja so pretty for? 
36,"May 1, 2021",Dokja is the KING of not giving a f*ck
36,"Mar 25, 2021","is no one gonna talk about the constellation ""secluded economics student"""
36,"Mar 17, 2021","Dokja: *causes chaos* Also Dokja: *so-done-smile* ""Ah naptime. Finally. Have fun storming the castle, Pildu."" Everyone else: *scared confused screaming*"
36,"Mar 16, 2021",AAAA GILYEONG GROWLING
36,"Mar 6, 2021",Dokja is just between good and bad. He helps people but he can also leave them to rot and die if needed. 
36,"Mar 5, 2021",Expectation: drawn by Sleepy-CReality: filmed by the dokkaebi 
36,"Mar 3, 2021","now I lay me down to sleep, just kidding my brain will weep, my interest this story keeps, therefore I foresee a lack of sleep, my bag of coins is dwindling low, I sincerely do enjoy the show, so I say before I go. SIKE here's 5 more coins how is dokja kim's plan gonna go?"
36,"Mar 3, 2021","*Raging monsters slaughtering dozens of people*   MC: Now is a good time for a nap
lol"
36,"Mar 2, 2021",LOOK AT THE KID COPYING THE WAY DOKJA SITS OH FATHER AND SON CRUMBS BAYBEEE
36,"Feb 28, 2021",Dokja is literally so badass I love him 
36,"Feb 27, 2021",Did anyone notice gilyeong growling at the man who said I’m sorry?
36,"Feb 26, 2021",This is why I love Dokja's character so much. Even Junghyeok wouldn't be able to pull this off. He'd probably just do the whole thing by himself though. Dokja is much much more cooler than Junghyeok though.
36,"Feb 25, 2021","ohhhh dude, thats prettt clever.

by having them chase them downstairs to where the monsters spawn, he destroyed the stairs, and essentially trapped them there.

either those pildu gang survive, or get eaten by monsters. dokja really is cunning"
36,"Feb 25, 2021","lol 'the constellation, secluded economics student, is excited by the destruction'- the writer knows us too well 😅"
36,"Feb 24, 2021",The old man really did go bald just because of that 😂

36,"Feb 24, 2021","Please let us know what the Constellation, ""Eyes waiting for Tuesday Night"", is doing. The remaining sentence is covered by Bihyeon's private message."
36,"Feb 24, 2021",waiting for 7 days to read 1 episode cause I'm broke? worth it. 💖༎ຶ‿༎ຶ👍
36,"Feb 24, 2021","""I'm not going to help u this time""  Dokja : I don't need your help. Lol,we stan a savage amazing MC🤣🤣"

36,"Feb 24, 2021",Constellations breaking the fourth wall as always
36,"Feb 24, 2021","""Eyes Waiting for Tuesday Night"" 🤣 My Constellation is ""Anxiety of Wednesday Morning"" because I never know what evil plan Dokja's mind will give birth 😅"
36,"Feb 24, 2021",Dokja is smart but a little crazy but that’s why I love this comic
36,"Feb 24, 2021",Can someone explain why Dokja saved that one random guy? Confused 
36,"Feb 24, 2021",So the scenarios were made so everyone there could fight them off if they didn’t squabble over petty territory. Oh wow I just summarized most of human history.
36,"Feb 24, 2021",Gilyoung is so protective over Dokja I love him sm 😭😭😭
36,"Feb 24, 2021","Wait, was Gilyoung growling at the injured man in one of the frames?"
36,"Feb 24, 2021","""The constellation eyes waiting for Tuesday night"" yeah I saw it "

36,"Feb 28, 2021","Now I’m curious if that seemingly unnecessary use of bookmark will have significance later. The acknowledgement that “it didn’t go like you said it would” felt like more foreshadowing that his “omniscient reader” skill isn’t as omniscient as it seems. If it wasn’t, then it was just an excuse to pad space which is sad, there already isn’t enough in these chapters anymore for them to start to get padded D:"
36,"Feb 27, 2021",I find the story really interesting and super entertaining but am I the only one for who Dokja seems a bit too at ease with the situation? it 's still his first time in this death game
