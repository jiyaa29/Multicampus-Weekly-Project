Episode,Date,Review
40,"Feb 3, 2021","I've sunk so many coins into this series, I might as well be Kim Dokja's sponsor "
40,"Feb 3, 2021","Yo the Hammer of Thor! And GILYEOUNG can hold that shit lol, He is a GOD bless him "
40,"Feb 3, 2021", I knew that kid was gonna be a god!! ...Stop...Hammer time ⚡️🔨⚡️⚒
40,"Feb 4, 2021","For those who are into foreign films, that last one is a historical film: The Admiral: Roaring Currents. It's based off the Japanese invasion of Korea in the 1500s. Admiral Yi Sun Shin was a God of Naval Warfare and managed to defeat a fleet of over 120 Japanese warships with a mere 13.  The Japanese ships were larger and more numerous, but clever use of the tides and tactics allowed him to prevail. Great film."
40,"Feb 3, 2021",Is it just me or is the boy gonna be the strongest character ever? 
40,"Feb 3, 2021","""The constellation, The Secretive Plotter, expresses his distaste for spoilers."" Me, the broke lazy reader agrees. And yes, that includes light novel readers who spoil as well :P"
40,"Feb 3, 2021","A sword known to be the most beautiful out of a collection of five. A shield used by a demigod. A hammer used by a literal GOD. A whole floor with limitless potential on being replicas of insane weapons and armor, YET dokja grabs the MOST ordinary prop: a fukin standard armor suit. [ The broke reader is amused and bewildered. 5 coins has been given ]. Nice choice lol"
40,"Feb 3, 2021",So nobody going to say something about the hat gilyeong picked up? 🤔
40,"Feb 3, 2021","character....real person.... dammit jihye just had to remind him that this was a novel turned reality huh 💀 let the man clear the scenarios in peace without reminding that this is the world of a novel and almost everybody is a character.also, gilyeong is one strong boi 👀"
40,"Feb 4, 2021","""Don't spoil it. They're might be people who haven't seen the movie.""  Kim Dokja Indirectly advising people in this comment section Haha"
40,"Feb 3, 2021","A NINE floor movie theatre??? Well damn, do they show every movie released that month or what?? "
40,"Feb 3, 2021","Ahhh Yes ""The Incredible Huck"" One of Marvels strongest Avengers..."
40,"Feb 3, 2021",YU JOONGHYUK CLEARED INCEPTION AND FINAL DESTINATION BY HIMSELF 
40,"Feb 3, 2021",this years biggest mystery: what did junghyeok see when he saw gilyeong’s profile 
40,"Feb 3, 2021",I wonder what the hat Gilyeoung took does.
40,"Feb 3, 2021","bro gilyeong is living emboidment of ""Hold my beers"""
40,"Feb 3, 2021","I'm totally agree with the constellation The Secretive Plotter, how distasteful are spoilers. "
40,"Feb 3, 2021",Dokja is the perfect mc
40,"Feb 3, 2021","There you go, Secretive Plotter said it themselves: Spoilers are detestable, don't do it "
40,"Feb 5, 2021",At least they didn't have to deal with John Wick 😅
40,"Feb 3, 2021",[The constellation 'Lazy Broke Weeb' praises the incarnation LGY for being worthy!.] [The constellation 'Lazy Broke Weeb' is also curious on how did the incarnation YJH cleared that movie.] [5 coins have been sponsored.]
40,"Feb 5, 2021",looks like we have Captain America and Thor
40,"Mar 24, 2021","ah yes. I to watch Huck, Johnn and Losers of the Caribbean"
40,"Feb 17, 2021",This regressor straight up killed the hulk and John Wick off screen 
40,"Feb 3, 2021",Is Gilyeong like the secret main character with the most potential? Did he just continuously die in the train car after each regression in the story so he was never a main character of TWSA? But he’s actually gonna become (one of) the most strong?? Please???
40,"Feb 3, 2021",Huiwon looks FINE af in that dress holy moly
40,"Feb 3, 2021","I would be worried, but Dokja is basically the best general you could ask for, they gots this!"
40,"Feb 3, 2021",SECRETIVE PLOTTER SHOWS DISTASTE FOR SPOILERS. you little shit. 
40,"Feb 3, 2021",when you use this many coins to get this far in the fast pass there ain't no going back
40,"Feb 3, 2021",I really wish someone could like this pls? I just got surgery for my teeth and it hurts like hell so 😖
40,"Mar 24, 2021",They're kill a movie character. But they're also characters from twsa. But all of them are ALSO characters from Omniscient Reader. So many layers of meta @_@
40,"Mar 24, 2021",And here I am expecting they'd do the signature pose in Titanic
40,"Mar 25, 2021",Thor: IM STILL WORTHY!!!                                                 A child who controls bugs: b*tch please
40,"Mar 24, 2021","Ah yes, I love watching “Losers of the Caribbean.” My favorite movie."
40,"Feb 4, 2021",The way that jihye throw up when asking dokja are him the dicaprio 😂😂😂 lol poor dokja 🤣
40,"Feb 4, 2021","Guy, it’s the Armor, he’s wearing the armor in the prologue, which means the first season might end soon 😭(edit) ight my worries have been lifted thank you all 😗"
40,"Feb 3, 2021","Okay, when he screamed for Jihye..... WHERE THE HELL IS JIHYE???!!"
40,"Mar 24, 2021",Dokja is hot in those armor omg 😭
40,"Mar 24, 2021",ok kid now put the mjolnir in a elevator and see if it go up
40,"Mar 24, 2021",This is what Dokja was wearing in the prologue!! 
40,"Feb 3, 2021",could someone give a a list of the name abbreviations? much easier than typing and inevitably misspelling the names
40,"Mar 24, 2021",Ooh is Jihye the general? Make sense since she was chosen by the naval constellation
40,"Mar 24, 2021",How did he beat John Wick!?!?!? that's impossible😭😭
40,"Mar 24, 2021","if i ever do cosplay, i choose Dokja in millitary armor as my first character 😢😍⚘ *chef's kiss*"
40,"Mar 24, 2021",Dokja looks so proud of Gilyeoung for lifting the hammer 😄
40,"Mar 24, 2021","So many Easter eggs. Titanic, Pirates of the carribean, John Wick, the Hulk. Its fun looking out for them. Really hope that Easter eggs continue in some form or fashion as the series progress. Maybe funny callbacks to other webtoons could happen. "
40,"Mar 24, 2021","If Dokja sees the people around him as characters I'm just glad that he's somewhat emotionally attached to them coz this story would've been very different if he decided to just ""get rid"" of the ""characters"" he didn't like"
40,"Mar 24, 2021","Btw for those who don’t know, this movie is The Admiral: Roaring Currents. It’s about Admiral Yi Sunsin which broke records when it was released. "
40,"Feb 3, 2021",I too agree with the distance of spoilers
40,"Feb 3, 2021",Cliff hangers are ilegal *brings out the legendary chancla*
40,"Mar 24, 2021",Is it just me or do they look like the avengers 😂
40,"Mar 17, 2021",Dokja thinking how people see characters as non real people the same way constelations see people and he saw the characters of twsa.
40,"Mar 25, 2021","somehow I got the vibe that those are Not ""replicas"". they are real, because the Cinema master makes them as real as the movies. fun Fact: I Just previously called Gilyeoung the chosen one for fun...now he lifts thors hammer. you made me proud boy"
40,"Mar 24, 2021","an additional skill should've been added too when dokja wore that vest, ""your visuals have been enhanced, you've become hotter and more handsome."" 🤧"
40,"Mar 27, 2021","I KNEW it was Admiral Yi SunShin and his amazing victory w 13 ships vs the Japanese's 133!! as a korean (young lol) patriot, it makes me really excited to see literally one if not the greatest, most patriotic and brilliant military commanders in media. So much respect to you author. "
40,"Mar 24, 2021","I can’t wait for the next chapter, Jihye is gonna go offffff. Also, PSA! If you like this story, please be sure to check out the original web novel version of it. There are a lot more details and it really makes the plot line more cohesive. I just finished reading it, and the whole story was so great. It’s definitely worth your time! Link if anyone’s interested: https://www.google.com/amp/s/m.webnovel.com/amp/book/12524375106746605"
40,"Mar 24, 2021","All us Avenger fans trying not to remember when Tony, Thor, and Cap America had the discussion of Mjölnir and the elevator!!😅😂"
40,"Mar 24, 2021",I love the idea of this ark so much
40,"Feb 3, 2021","I know we on movies right now, but I can help but feel like that book was a Gravity Falls joke"
40,"Mar 25, 2021",I just realized that the movies are yet another layer of fiction— this is getting out of hand 
40,"Mar 24, 2021",The fantastic Huck
40,"Apr 3, 2021","Imagine having to go through Final Destination AND Inception by yourself? that's crazy...also what do you MEAN ""LOSERS of the Caribbean""?! "
40,"Mar 25, 2021",that movie scene is from an actual history event in South Korea. its known as the battle of myeongnyang. japan vs South Korea.
40,"Mar 24, 2021",OMFG Dokja this new item look... very fine on you 😳
40,"Mar 24, 2021",even the constellations hate spoilers xD
40,"Mar 24, 2021",Me and Secretive Plotter 🤝 hating spoilers
40,"Mar 24, 2021","Gilyeong, god of thunder"
40,"Mar 24, 2021","lol, what's the movie about? the ship sinks. "
40,"Mar 24, 2021","Lol, I would be glad Inception was already cleared too. Inception is a mind-twisting psychological action movie and you would need a genius IQ to pass it."
40,"Feb 3, 2021","JIHYE TIME TO SHIIIINNNEEEE~✧ don't worry lass, the seasick usually goes away if you're on the water long enough.... But then you get seasick again when you go on land... Oh well? Uhm. Look at the horizon. That helps. "
40,"Mar 24, 2021",Huiwon looked really pretty in that dress. It's a sincere compliment
40,"Mar 24, 2021",Why does Dokja look so hot in that armor?? Like WHYYY?? AND HOW??
40,"Mar 24, 2021","for anyone who wants to watch the movie they are currently in, the title is: The Admiral Roaring Currents"
40,"Mar 26, 2021",I haven't seen titanic yet so thank you author for blocking the spoiler 
40,"Mar 26, 2021","we just gonna ignore the movie ""LOSERS of the Caribbean""????"
40,"Mar 25, 2021","I, too, wonder how he beat final destination lol..."
40,"Mar 24, 2021","Let’s be honest here, we’re all sponsoring the little guy."
40,"Mar 24, 2021",Easily my top 5 favorite WebToon. I'm addicted to the story and can't wait to see where it goes. Fingers crossed it gets adapted to anime in the future
40,"Mar 24, 2021",Pfft all that treasure and Gilyeong picked up a hat- At least he was ~worthy~ of Thor’s hammer :D
40,"Mar 24, 2021",Imagine having to go against John Wick. 😬
40,"Mar 24, 2021","Oh Don’t tell me that Jihye is “Sunsin Lee”. How would she command her crew, if she has seasickness?... This is definitely gonna go wrong."
40,"Mar 24, 2021",The poster: 🅱️irassic Park
40,"Feb 3, 2021",man I love the progression  of the webtoon it makes me so happy that this exists the web novel is so amazing I can't wait to those of you who dont read it get to see some of the future scenarios and the way things work out for our beloved Kim dokja
40,"Feb 3, 2021","So no one is curious about how Yoo Jonghyuk clear Inception? I mean, who did he have to kill to complete that movie? Leonardo deCarpio? "
40,"May 8, 2021","Losers of the Caribbean, Huck, Jonny, This is killing me 😂"
40,"Mar 29, 2021","Lol. ""Huck"", ""John Ni"", and ""Loser's of the Caribbean"""
40,"Mar 26, 2021",Dokja be looking fineee
40,"Mar 25, 2021",I’m not gonna lie... Dokja in that armor hits different
40,"Mar 25, 2021",i love it that dokja is not the ml in titanic...
40,"Mar 24, 2021",H u c k
40,"Jul 18, 2021",Don't forget Losers of the Caribbean. XD
40,"May 18, 2021","When Dokja thought ""just a character... a real person"" it must have been pretty heavy for him, considering technically everyone around him is also ""just a character"" from the comic, yet they are right in front of him, living and breathing like a ""real person"". "
40,"May 7, 2021",GILYEONG LIFTED MJOLNIR WHEW THIS CHILD IS GODSENT
40,"Apr 26, 2021",the amount of references in this chapter is amazing✨
40,"Apr 8, 2021",Are we just going to ignore the ‘Losers of the Caribbean’ poster? Ok.
40,"Apr 3, 2021","i can't even imagine what a nightmare clearing ""ingception"" must have been omg my brain would have been fried to a crisp"
40,"Mar 29, 2021","Me, not a korean, not knowing what movie that is 🥲🙂"
40,"Mar 25, 2021",THE KID IS WORTHY
40,"Mar 25, 2021","So every constellation is a famous person/myth that we prob know. When Jihye's constellation was mentioned as the god of naval battle, Koreans could probably assume her constellation as sunshin lee cuz hes the most famous naval battle hero in Korea. Thats why a few eps ago, when the guy in chungmuro station called jihye 'little samuri' dokja thought that he would regret that when he finds out jihye's constellation. The Myungryang battle is Lee's most famous battle, thats why dokja is calling jih"
40,"Mar 24, 2021","one of the posters was, losers of the caribbean 😂😂😂"
40,"Mar 24, 2021",“Then is he the male... BARF 🤮 “ LMAAAAAAAO 🤣💀👏🏻
40,"Mar 24, 2021",The child is the chosen one!
40,"Mar 24, 2021","The references are amazing, I love Losers of the Caribbean!"
40,"Mar 24, 2021",Why is nobody talking about how s👏e👏x👏y Dokja looks in that suit??!?
40,"Mar 24, 2021",*reads losers of the Caribbean* STOP BLOWING HOLES IN MY SHIP!
40,"Mar 24, 2021","fighting destination?? its refer to FINAL DESTINATION?!! WHAT THE HELL, HOW YOO JONGHYUK CAN CLEAR THAT MOVIE?!"
40,"Mar 18, 2021",I like how the author made the mc think about whether the people in the story he’s living are inanimate characters or living people for which morals matter. 
40,"Feb 4, 2021",are you kidding? i just started this series last night.  it took all my coins lol
40,"Sep 18, 2021","Ahh, yes; Mjölnir, the Hammer that Thor himself needs magical gloves and a strength-boosting belt to lift, lifted by a 9 year old who can talk to fleas. Truly, a situation more classic and refined than a vintage 1882 red wine. "
40,"Jul 31, 2021",*puts on chris hemsworth impression* i’m still worthy!!!
40,"May 11, 2021","that moment when u, a character from a webtoon, hear a character from a book inside said webtoon call a character from a movie ""not a real person"" and ""just a character"""
40,"Mar 26, 2021",That boy really likes his bludgeon weapon
40,"Mar 26, 2021",This is the same outfit djoka is wearing in the beginning of the series.
40,"Mar 25, 2021","I'm pretty certain that the movie reference on the 6th floor is the 6th sense. It is indeed a thriller with a twist, and the theme of only seeing what you want and have been conditioned to see matches the sharp observation skill that was paired with the movie. It's one of my favorite movies, and really, all the references in here are on point 👌!"
40,"Mar 25, 2021",But all real people are basically just characters in that stream that constellations are watching so what does REAL actually mean anymore? 
40,"Mar 25, 2021",Didn't anyone notice John Wick's Poster
40,"Mar 24, 2021",I want to know what items Jihye got
40,"Mar 24, 2021",Losers Of The Caribbean😆
40,"Mar 24, 2021",Entertained reader is pleased with the story!!!
40,"Mar 24, 2021",Dokja understands how spoilers feel like. so he stopped her 🤧
40,"Mar 24, 2021",Dokja be looking good in that outfit 👀
40,"Mar 24, 2021",Am I the only one drooling over Dokja’s new look?
40,"Mar 24, 2021",fingerless gloves 😳😳😳
40,"Mar 24, 2021",Of course Gilyeoung is worthy of Mjolnir. There’s no other person in that group who would be worthy (sorry y’all lol)
40,"Feb 3, 2021","so we have a mini thorcaptain america
and not 1 but 2 sword users 
might as well be a marvel movie"
40,"Feb 3, 2021","He got the armor from the preview, I wonder if that means that fight scene is going to happen soon? Where dokja is clashing blades with junghyeok. Also i love that little gilyeong is able to weild mjolnor. Makes sense because he is younger and still a lot more pure then the other characters."
40,"Feb 3, 2021","This webtoon is soo addictive, I just can’t stop!"
40,"Jul 28, 2021",so no one has noticed how it says kulk not hulk and losers of the Caribbean no the pirates of the Caribbean 
40,"May 31, 2021","If someone’s interested in this movie, its title is The Admiral:Roaring Currents (2014)"
40,"May 2, 2021","So is no one gonna talk about how Gilyeoung was able to wield a Mjolnir? Only a person with a heart of a hero are chosen to wield it, and some chapters ago, he was willing to kill people on behalf of their survival. Maybe the Mjolnir is just different here, and only the person that are ""special"" are able to wield it. Hyeongsung might've been capable of wielding it (I think)"
40,"May 1, 2021","LOL, ""Losers of the Caribbean"""
40,"Apr 28, 2021",Gilyeong is worthy 
40,"Apr 7, 2021",Dokja as Captain America and Gilyeong as Thor. Avengers when?
40,"Apr 6, 2021","""HUCK"""
40,"Mar 31, 2021","That ""Losers of the Caribbean"" poster though 😂😂😂 and Heewon and Gilyeong being turned into Jack and Rose from Titanic was ✌️👌😅"
40,"Mar 30, 2021",for the John Wick movie did the person have to fight AGAINST the dog loving man himself or what? 
40,"Mar 28, 2021",ooh I thought this cinema arc was just a cool way to incorporate new environments but I see u questioning your existence as a character/person dokja
40,"Mar 28, 2021",it’s amazing how what jihye said made dokja have some reflection because just as how the people in the theater were characters to them jihye and others are characters to dokja
40,"Mar 26, 2021",Gilyeong is worthy. 
40,"Mar 26, 2021","Oh the irony of Jihyee... ""character"" ""real people""- That's you, Jihyee."
40,"Mar 25, 2021","Jihye being so upset again after loosing Thor's hammer to none other than Gilyeong😂😂🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️And, why is Dokja calling Jihye in the last panel? Is he planning to bribe her constellation? Since, he's the naval warfare guy, I guess..... Dude, why is Dokja so unpredictable? I still love him though cause #DokjaistheBestProtagonist"
40,"Mar 25, 2021",I love how the kid doesn’t even react to being able to lift Thor’s hammer and just asks if he can take it
40,"Mar 25, 2021",He is worthy!
40,"Mar 25, 2021",HES WORTHY!!!
40,"Mar 25, 2021","""Losers of the Carribbean"" 😂😂Wow great movie"
40,"Mar 24, 2021","What was special about the hat, Gilyeoung? And was there not enough items for Jihye to get one or was she just being stubborn and picky? 😅"
40,"Mar 24, 2021",I’m just realizing that this is a fiction-ception lol we are reading a manhwa where dokja is the main character and in the webcomic he reads the others are the characters and tgese characters are inside movies and meet others characters... and dokja is having an identity crisis
40,"Mar 24, 2021",I-... I guess Gilyeoung is the new king of Asgard...
40,"Mar 24, 2021",the general is jihye's sponsor right? the naval warfare god yi sun shin? then she will be the main character of the movie :D
40,"Mar 24, 2021",Gilyeong holding that hammer was such a Peter Parker moment
40,"Mar 24, 2021",Dokja be looking like a snacc with that suit 😏😳
40,"Mar 24, 2021","[""Witness of the Endless stories"" is smiling at the characters evolution about to take place]"
40,"Mar 24, 2021",idk if anyone else noticed this but when (idk remember who exactly) killed the villain from titanic it parallels from Dokja bc most of them r ready just characters from a book he's read so he's probably thinking whether or not its ok to kill others especially if they are just fictional villains from a book if you know what I mean
40,"Mar 24, 2021",Secretive Plotter and I have that in common we hate spoilers for movies that have a good horror vibe to it 
40,"Mar 24, 2021",The rise of Admiral Lee Jihye
40,"Mar 24, 2021","Wait- Dokjas vest is the same one he had in the prologue Edit: It is an A grade item, which is second best to my understanding, so it makes sense he wouldn't replace it if it didn't need replacing "
40,"Feb 7, 2021",love how Dokja lowkey picked up armor items because his teammates are more suited for attack.. his natural approach to keep the team in balance is topnotch
40,"Feb 6, 2021",This would be a great time to reread the first episode. There’s a lot of foreshadowing in that episode about what’s coming next. Dokja is going to fight Jungheok.
40,"Feb 3, 2021",I am running out of coins. Do you accept doge??
40,"Feb 3, 2021",Gil is FLEXING this chapter. casual w/ the hat and the hammer.《Eyes Waiting for Tuesday Night donates 100 coins to Gilyeoung》
40,"Feb 3, 2021",How does one WIN against John Wick...
40,"Feb 3, 2021", The Battle of Myeongnyang!! I love this movie. The whirlpool better still be part of the plot. I wonder which turtle ship they are on? *hopeful foreshadowing*
40,"Feb 3, 2021",Jihye is one cute boy in the titanic 
40,"Feb 3, 2021","Jihye, naval God constellation, help?"
40,"Oct 4, 2021",YALL DONT UNDERSTAND IM LITERALLY SH!TT!NG TEARS RN I CANT BELIEVE THAT LITTLE BOY WAS ABLE TO PICK UP THE HAMMER😭😭 AND THE LOOK ON HER FACE WAS PRICELESS 
40,"Aug 5, 2021",‘Losers of the Caribbean’ I am dying 😂
40,"Jun 7, 2021",GILYEOUNG IS WORTHY! THOR IS SHOOK! MY MARVEL FANGIRL ASS IS ALSO SHOOK! 
40,"Jun 1, 2021",how tf do you even beat final destination
40,"May 7, 2021",[The Late Reader agrees with Secretive Plotter]
40,"May 7, 2021","dude when dokja said ""a character, a real person..."" he was really just talking about how the lines are so blurred for him, huh? bc these people were characters to him"
40,"May 2, 2021",'Losers of the Caribbean' is OP not a fan of pirates???
40,"Apr 28, 2021",Umm why did I think of gravity falls when I saw that book
40,"Apr 28, 2021",birassic park😂😂
40,"Apr 27, 2021",I think we all knew gilyeong was gonna be able to pick up that hammer lmaoo
40,"Apr 27, 2021",nobody is gonna comment on how that book is from gravity Falls?? okay 👌
40,"Apr 7, 2021",YOO THIS IS TRIPPY!! They see the movie characters as just characters. Dokja sees them as characters? AND WE SEE THEM AS CHARACTERS!! WTF 😱 
40,"Apr 2, 2021",Our boy is worthy!!  Y’all got this!
40,"Mar 31, 2021",I think i know who the secretive plotter is i believe that he is the author just think about it he was never itroduced in twtsa according to Dokja and what would the author be doing he could have gone after the protagonist and survived but he's nowhere to be found 
40,"Mar 27, 2021","""Losers of the Caribbean"" lmao i saw that😂"
40,"Mar 27, 2021","Gonna drop this two points here for the ppl be aware of how the story goes(This is not spoiler though), just to brush it off some expectations.1 - Characters relationships unfolds nice, but is just friendly, like a Scooby Doo show, romance here is non existent so dont expect that (not even a kiss), unless the artist change the source material.
2 - The ending is a open ending, like Bastard or Sweet Home from webtoon. I particularly not like this style.
Still its a great and long story, enjoy it."
40,"Mar 27, 2021",They had no right making Dokja so damn fine 😩😩✋
40,"Mar 26, 2021",Gilyeong is my SON. HE DESERVES THE MOON SUN AND STARS. 
40,"Mar 26, 2021",Dojka is looking real cute with that outfit
40,"Mar 26, 2021","Look at him, he’s growing up so fast"
40,"Mar 26, 2021",Me thinks the authors doesn't like Pirates of the Caribbean XD
40,"Mar 25, 2021",WOW the kid is worthy
40,"Mar 25, 2021",Losers of the Caribbean ahahahahaaaa
40,"Mar 25, 2021",[THE READERS OF THIS WEBTOON ARE SOMEWHAT ANNOYED AT THIS CLIFFHANGER]
40,"Mar 25, 2021",Man when I read the novel I always imagined his armor being an iron man suit. 
40,"Mar 25, 2021",does the author have something against pirates of the Caribbean?
40,"Mar 25, 2021","ayo why is this so good. PETITION TO MAKE THIS AN ANIME, CDRAMA/KDRAMA OR DONGHUA 😭😭😭"
40,"Mar 25, 2021",Can you imagine if the infinity stones was a reward item?
40,"Mar 24, 2021",I'm disappointed that Goofy wasn't hiding in the poster for The Incredible HýUCK

40,"Apr 30, 2021","you took out admiral yi sun sin? how the eff dare you? this is blasphemy! okno but seriously it would have been cool to see him, or his son. i don't think he will appear either, but what about the girl, wasn't she chosen by a constellation about naval warfare or smth (cant recall the name, I'm terrible with them)? "
40,"Apr 30, 2021",didn't think I'll find mikazuki munechika here😭😂
40,"Apr 30, 2021",I love the ending of dokja screaming jihye's name. she is their only hope now let's unleash the power of the war-time naval general lee jihye!!!
40,"Apr 30, 2021","Ah yes, my favorite movie. The Huck"
40,"Apr 30, 2021",Dokja is finally in the outfit from the prolog! 
40,"Apr 30, 2021",dude I saw the water I started playing the pirates of the Caribbean theme song in my head 😂 I was so wrong
40,"Apr 30, 2021","IM SPECIAL TOO, DAMN IT"
40,"Apr 30, 2021",dokja looks so good in that suit😍😍
40,"Apr 29, 2021","Reading this now and seeing the mention of final destination, it explains why I felt the same eerie feeling in episode 1 as when I watch final destination(which I freaking love!). Damn. Author must be a fan. And I'm a fan of both!"
40,"Apr 29, 2021",That baffled face of hers is everything 
40,"Apr 29, 2021",Lol he cleared fighting (final) destination? Respect.
40,"Apr 29, 2021",Now Dokja looks even more charming ❤🧡💛
40,"Apr 29, 2021","I just realized that Dokja's armor got the female armor treatment. It says it protects the ""lower body"" too, but we only see a thigh strap and kneepads. Very practical lower body protection..."
40,"Apr 29, 2021","Gilyeong is the right choice for the protagonist in that movie. He’s the most cute and charming character! ❤️  Anyone knows witch movie they told about in the chapter, about the twisted ending? The thriller one..."
40,"Apr 29, 2021","""Birassic Park""🤚😭"
40,"Apr 29, 2021",when we saw that the hulk movie is cleared does that mean that he BEAT HULK :-: 
40,"Apr 29, 2021",DOKJA KINDA LOOKS LIKE KAKASHI 😭😭
40,"Apr 28, 2021","the likes keep going down each chapter just like in TWSA, and its both sad for the author and worrying for us T~T"
40,"Apr 28, 2021",losers of the Caribbean 😂😂
40,"Apr 28, 2021","OMG OMG i know this movie. i've watched it before.Title: The Admiral: roaring Currents
Based on the historical Battle of Myeongnyang, it stars an ensemble cast led by Choi Min-sik as the Korean naval commander Yi Sun-sin. The film was released theatrically in South Korea on July 30, 2014."
40,"Apr 28, 2021",I absolutely LOVE the details of this Webtoon!! Even the list of (fake) actors is amazing to see!! I remember seeing the original Jurassic Park in the theaters.
40,"Apr 28, 2021",Inception!!! I love that movie 
40,"Apr 28, 2021",may it be in the webtoon or the novel... Gilyeong's my favorite character.

40,"Apr 27, 2021",who is that kid and why can he pick up Thor's hammer????????
40,"Apr 27, 2021",The constellation Reader called Rica is feeling slightly sympathetic towards incarnation Jihye. 😂 
40,"Apr 27, 2021","Yoo, dojka is wearing the same armour as he was in the first episode"
40,"Apr 27, 2021",john n! is such a good movie tbh
40,"Apr 27, 2021",Dammmn those fits 🔥
40,"Apr 26, 2021",i wonder what's the reward that high school girl and the the kendo girl choose for herself and her female friend
40,"Apr 26, 2021",One of the reasons why the novel and webtoon are better when you’re Korean is because there are subtle details which only Koreans or those who lived in Korea would know and it makes the scenes much more meaningful and substantial.
40,"Apr 26, 2021",THE CHILD IS WORTHY 
40,"Apr 26, 2021",Ayoo Pirates of the caribbean salazars revenge??

40,"Apr 16, 2021","We don't do Hulk here. Yeah, It's Huck. You have a problem?"

40,"Apr 11, 2021","The rip on the ""Losers of the Caribbean"" poster changed direction from one panel to the next. The first one had it go from bottom left to top right, and the second was top left to bottom right."
40,"Apr 10, 2021",All these movie names are fantastic. 
40,"Apr 10, 2021",As soon as I saw Mjolnir I knew Gilyeong would be worthy. 
40,"Apr 10, 2021","I kind of want them to enter the Movie ""John Ni"""

If he had, before the series started would he have found that they lived in the same world as him? "

40,"Mar 25, 2021",As an American I don’t know this movie which makes me disappointed in myself because I consider myself a cinemaster. Could someone help me with this movie.
40,"Mar 25, 2021",Dude! I have to wait another week? 😩😭
40,"Mar 25, 2021",battleship time
40,"Mar 25, 2021",where is dokja's Armor from which movie?? and damn he Sir looks amazing in it
40,"Mar 25, 2021",Wait...what movie is the armor from?
40,"Mar 25, 2021",for a minute i thought it was going to be sharknado
40,"Mar 24, 2021",i love how long the chapters are
40,"Mar 24, 2021",WHAT HAPPENED TO JIHYE?
40,"Mar 24, 2021",Gileyong can easily destroy everyone with thunder!! He is thor
40,"Mar 24, 2021",Another great episode I would spend coin but im just too poor. 
40,"Mar 24, 2021","ok, so this has been kind of bothering me. when Dokja saw that he was going into real movies in TWSA, shouldn't he have gotten a bit suspicious? I guess thinking it would come true is a bit of a leap though, since I don't think any of the movies they've entered were ones from after TWSA, I could be wrong"
40,"Mar 24, 2021",Chris Hensworth would be so proud!
40,"Mar 24, 2021",I got excited that this updated then I rembered i fast passes like 2-3 weeks ahead 😭
40,"Mar 24, 2021",Who does he call at the end ? I am really bad with names 😅
40,"Mar 24, 2021",Things keep escalating😱
40,"Mar 24, 2021","Why did Dokja shouted for Jihye? Didn't she mention she has seasickness? I also didn't see her choosing any rewards for herself so Dokja couldn't be asking for her weapon or something. Or is he calling her Constellation for help since he is the God of Naval Warfare after all? Also I wonder what special properties does Gilyeong's cool cap have though? Nonetheless, good for him to finally have a proper hammer to swing around now 😆"
40,"Mar 24, 2021",as great as Gil's hammer moment was. can we take a moment to appreciate how cute our little warmonger was in that dress? 😂
40,"Mar 24, 2021","HAHAH, THE BOY IS THE KIMG OF ASGAURD "
40,"Mar 24, 2021",did Jihye leave them????
40,"Mar 24, 2021",Why didn't Jihye get anything? Was thor's hammer the only thing left? 
40,"Mar 24, 2021","wait, observation skill, like the gamer? "
40,"Mar 24, 2021",where the heck is my gurl jihye?
40,"Mar 24, 2021",Thor and Cap you have a new companion... Gilyoung with his pocker face is alwas the best one

40,"Mar 24, 2021",i think theres gonna be more readers since he wasnt the onely one reading it but i hope if they got twsa that they onely got it as far as theyve read it
40,"Mar 24, 2021",Bruh I’ve been reading this on an illegal site 💀 I didn’t know this was on webtoon 
40,"Mar 24, 2021",Gilyeoung has a serious potential! He can even lift that hammer! Does that mean he can use the power of lightning? Nice!
40,"Mar 24, 2021",Aww Gilyeong’s little hat is so cuteeee
40,"Mar 24, 2021",Gilyeong lifting Thor’s hammer is the most wholesome thing I’ve seen all day! 
40,"Mar 24, 2021",let's be honest...if they went into john wick they would've died
40,"Mar 24, 2021",dokja drip
40,"Mar 24, 2021","I wonder where Jihye is, what if she's leading the japanese fleet?Or maybe she'll come in all dramatic with reinforcement turtle ships!"
40,"Mar 24, 2021","“I’m special too, damn it!”"
40,"Mar 24, 2021",I think I know why Jungheyuk is deciding to just die now. If you look at the torn posters 1 of them is John Wick so maybe he played as John Wick and they killed his dog and took his car. So the pain of losing his dog and car was much to great and now hes like its time to die. IT ALL MAKES SENSE.
40,"Mar 24, 2021",He may be strong but its complete cap that he beat John Wick 
40,"Mar 24, 2021","oh dang, the line between character and real person must seem pretty interesting to dokja"

40,"Jan 3, 2022",anyone know the movie with the book and the triangle on it? they said it's a thriller but I don't think I know this one
40,"Jan 3, 2022",15 sit-ups
40,"Jan 1, 2022",Gilyeong's pure heart gave him the ability to lift that hammer!!!
40,"Dec 30, 2021",Thor's hammer was so heavy that it hung my phone
40,"Dec 28, 2021",Did Dokja just broke the 4th wall?
40,"Dec 28, 2021",Ok but what was the thriller with a twist ending that gave them an illuminati book??
40,"Dec 26, 2021",Jesus loves you :)
40,"Dec 14, 2021",Wait what items did Jihye pick
40,"Dec 11, 2021",Can we appreciate the reference about the Mikazuki Munechika sword?? 🔥 I am expecting a Touken Ranbu appearance now.
40,"Dec 5, 2021",Loser of the Caribbean. Lol.
40,"Dec 4, 2021",Constellation DARK FLAME PHOENIX is worried for jihye.
40,"Dec 2, 2021",gilyeong LMAO
40,"Nov 30, 2021",Im mad we didnt get a pirates of the caribbean scenario...
40,"Nov 27, 2021","Yoooo Thor's hammer, Jonathan is here!!!"
40,"Nov 26, 2021",Gil picking up Thor's hammer is just amazing 
40,"Nov 26, 2021","We just gonna ignore a canon movie where a green muscly dude goes around yelling ""HUCK SMASH!""?"
40,"Nov 23, 2021",Ok so what if all characters are actually real person brought from the worlds the regressor has died in ???or something like that idk…
40,"Nov 19, 2021","I think there's something going on about Gilyeoung. Either he's just a pretty good, lucky and matured kid. I think he might be a regressor who has only regressed one time. "
40,"Nov 11, 2021",Something off 
40,"Nov 5, 2021","It's rather impressive how they changed the movie names, hulk became huck and pirates of the Caribbean became losers of the Caribbean. LOL"
40,"Nov 4, 2021",Gilyeoung was really like I have the high ground
40,"Nov 2, 2021",an Armada this time...oh boy...(on my 4th tub of popcorn)...🍿🍿🍿🍿
40,"Oct 28, 2021",Does anyone notice that the first scene is from titanic?!
40,"Oct 28, 2021","The way Gilyeong pulled out the hammer with ease, Style✨"
40,"Oct 28, 2021","I feel like the characters were acting out of their usual personality. It's usually Huiwon who disagrees to killing and Dokja who acts in a cold hearted manner. But in the ship movie, Huiwon was the one to agree with killing the character without any hesitation and Dokja was the one who felt more hesitant. It would have made more sense if Dokja said to kill him and Huiwon tried to stop him or atleast feel hesitant. Maybe it's just because it was a villain that Huiwon didn't feel anything idk."
40,"Oct 22, 2021",did Dokja take the gloves? because then that means he took 3 items not 2
40,"Sep 3, 2021",what the
40,"Sep 1, 2021",when i saw that single ship and the other ones headed towards it i knew exactly what it was.

40,"Jul 2, 2021","Oooh, he has the armor from the prologue where he was fighting the protag! Look at that~ Also lol Gilyeoung got Thor's hammer, I guess he can get rid of the rat's skull now, it suits him. Guess it chose him since she couldn't pick it up. The school girl's sponsor, it's the god of naval warfare, right? So I wonder if it's her time to shine now~"
40,"Jul 1, 2021",wow this dungeons sounds real fun
40,"Jun 28, 2021",Did Gilyeong pick the hat as his second item..? What does it even do   o_O

40,"Mar 29, 2021","@nobleassassin yeah, you are so right.. hahaha"
40,"Mar 28, 2021","I find it odd that webtoon is picking this up now, as it's been out for quite a while."
40,"Mar 28, 2021","Kinda reminds me of the gamer(Rewards,stats,Missions) Give thumbs up if you read the gamer"
40,"Mar 27, 2021",is anyone knows that last Korean movie name 
40,"Mar 26, 2021",Dat Huiwon
40,"Mar 25, 2021",殿の為に進めぇ!!!
40,"Mar 25, 2021",Its alot more confusing than the source material 
40,"Mar 25, 2021",BRO IHAVE NO MORE COINS AND I HAVE TO WAIT 6 DAYS FOR EPISODE 40 NOOOOOOO
40,"Mar 25, 2021",Hyeonsong can has his own story and I certainly read about this special kid. 
40,"Mar 25, 2021",Is Jihye Lee related to General Sunsin Lee? Is that why she has her attribute even though she gets seasick?
40,"Mar 25, 2021","sadly im not a korean, may i ask what movie are they in right now?"
40,"Mar 24, 2021","Am I the only one that gets really annoyed how comics always show characters wielding their shield and scabbard on opposite sides, you dont wield your sword in the same hand as you shield so they are supposed to be worn on the same side to make drawing it quickly possibleEdit: I should mention this is from my own experience training in mock combat with a short sword and shield."
40,"Mar 24, 2021",wew. I think jihyee will be the villain in that movie. goodluck guys
40,"Mar 24, 2021",who else thinks the hat is the reason why he got the hammer.
40,"Mar 24, 2021",i need to earn more coins...
40,"Mar 24, 2021",Where glass slipper?
40,"Mar 24, 2021",I was listening to Kill This Love on the last part of this episode...it fits so well 😂
40,"Mar 24, 2021",Gilyeong xD
40,"Mar 24, 2021",Thanks for the update 💙
40,"Mar 24, 2021",It’s weird seeing Dokja not know his every next move. The ending of this chapter was super unsettling to me
40,"Mar 24, 2021",Anyone else not get the notification or just me?
40,"Mar 24, 2021",i think i watched all the movies in one episode😅
40,"Mar 24, 2021",who's jihye??

40,"Mar 24, 2021",What movie is that?
40,"Mar 24, 2021",At least they didn't have to survive the sinking ship scenario.
40,"Mar 24, 2021","I kind of wish I knew who the heck these constellations are when they reveal them, but my knowledge of historical heroes of korea is 0%"
40,"Mar 24, 2021",what?! did jihye get moved or kidnapped or something by the cinema master?
40,"Mar 24, 2021","im curious on how the main character didnt connect the story to his surroundings, imagine reading 600 and sum chapters of something and still not realizing these battles and events are occuring in your area🤔😵"
40,"Mar 24, 2021",I think we all wanted to see a manhwa John Wick...
40,"Mar 24, 2021",Gilyoung is actually so OP 
40,"Mar 24, 2021",also i am dying gilyoung was just all chill as the main lead and everyone thought that was better xDD and huiwon in a dress!!

40,"Mar 24, 2021",*The most dumbest human* is excited for the next episode but doesn't have coins :)
40,"Mar 24, 2021",I thought it was sharknado for a second

40,"Mar 24, 2021",He is worthy.
40,"Mar 24, 2021","so, I went back to read the prologue, and realized that jungkyuk doesn't recognize Dokja. Does he end up dying and gets reincarnated, but feels threatened by Dokja again because he knows the story line and about him?"
40,"Mar 24, 2021",aww i knew my baby would be able to pick up the hammer
40,"Mar 24, 2021","""In Cinemas happy payday"", I feel you artist-ssi"
