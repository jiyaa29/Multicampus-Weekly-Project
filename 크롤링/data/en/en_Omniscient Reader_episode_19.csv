19,"Oct 28, 2020","I like how the female characters are portrayed as actual people. hell the most badass character right now is a rape victim, and DAMN she is a real survivor. I like how she wasn't just written as a damsel in distress"
19,"Oct 14, 2020",The constellation is intrigued with your decision to leave a cliff hanger [5 coins is rewarded][Writer has been activated] every week you will get this reward every week
19,"Oct 14, 2020",Them little evil fluffy things are cute 🤷🏻‍♀️
19,"Oct 21, 2020",If anything happens to Gilyeong lee IM THROWING HANDS
19,"Oct 14, 2020",I like the new chick
19,"Oct 14, 2020",The first time he’s been caught off guard. Yet he was still prepared. 
19,"Oct 21, 2020",YOU BET YOUR BUTT I USED THE COINS FROM THE FIVE DAY EVENT TO READ THIS
19,"Oct 14, 2020",Dude I was so exited to see the looks on everyone’s faces when they found out that the thing who ran the channel basically worked for him but damn I can’t tel if I’m sad or happy!

19,"Oct 21, 2020",when you spend the 5 coins you got from the reader's event on the reader's event..
19,"Oct 14, 2020",Ive decided to read both this comic and the novel 
19,"Oct 28, 2020","This is the first chapter where I have preferred this translation, almost purely because of the line: “a few constellations are relived you are not an IDIOT.” Also made a little more sense than the original translation I read"
19,"Oct 17, 2020",He really thought ahead. Not only does he know the future but he's extremely smart. If I were half as smart as him I could get into a great college
19,"Oct 14, 2020",Crouching figure hidden bamf more like it 
19,"Oct 28, 2020","""CROUCHING FIGURE is a common attribute, but has the potential to evolve into a LEGENDARY attribute"" so basically, Magikarp"
19,"Oct 28, 2020",1). i love the new girl 😌 2).the little boy is sooo cuteeee 🥰 we must protect him at all cost 
19,"Oct 14, 2020",AND JUNG HEEWON FINALLY YEEEEEEES
19,"Oct 28, 2020",I'm looking forward to her kill that rapest!
19,"Oct 28, 2020",I like her Huiwon has this badass side but also this sort of craziness. Also the fact that she has the demon slayer is so cool but it also means that she can become very dangerous and out of control 
19,"Oct 14, 2020",Ahhh I’ve never used 5 coins faster in my life
19,"Oct 28, 2020",i swear to god if something happens to that kid... #protectsmallbeans
19,"Oct 28, 2020","If ORV (Omniscient Reader) were to be featured in Webtoon Now, I wish they get to interview both the authors and artists. Fun fact, the authors for ORV's novel are a couple and I really want to know how they came up with such a great story, I've been so curious hehe"
19,"Oct 21, 2020",Hah! I just spent the free 5 coins that I earned from the 5 day survival challenge of this webtoon.
19,"Oct 28, 2020","Jeong Huiwon, girl it's nice to see your character design omg my fangirling ass is celebrating ;-;"
19,"Oct 28, 2020",GILYOUNG 👏 BEST 👏 BOY 👏
19,"Oct 28, 2020",Just noticed how Jeong Huiwon was wearing flats. THOSE are not good footwear for the apocalypse! (although obviously she didnt have time to change) 
19,"Oct 28, 2020","The little boy is an angel... well, hopefully for the rest of the comics"
19,"Oct 14, 2020","Ah yes, sir, one fast pass please. Here are your five coins. My gratitude. "
19,"Oct 14, 2020",An additional 5 coins have been deducted for your survival fee. 
19,"Oct 28, 2020",so basically “your free trial of life has ended”
19,"Oct 28, 2020","Ugh, Huiwon-ssi, I love her! Also, shameless scammer Kim Dokja, hahaha."
19,"Oct 28, 2020","so he got rid of food, knowing he would loose it anyway, in exchange for coins, wich can keep him alive longer? smartt"

19,"Oct 14, 2020",this is a dream come true. I cant wait for the anime 
19,"Jan 20, 2021",I'd be very suspicious if the number of readers of this webtoon drops down to 1 by the end of it 
19,"Oct 28, 2020","I really like how the attribute crouching figure has so much potential. It's like someone the Author only meant to be a background character, so her personality and powers aren't that fleshed out. and that's what gives her so many possibilities."
19,"Oct 28, 2020",I would die for Gilyeong no questions asked. The precious kid paid for the chocolate- I can't. I'm going to root for HIM the most now.
19,"Oct 28, 2020","NOoOoO the kid is too sweet, we need to protect him-"
19,"Oct 28, 2020",ah he took all of the money which is now more valuable 
19,"Oct 28, 2020","the kid is so sweet tho, he definitely cares about dokja"
19,"Oct 28, 2020","So that's the reason why Dokja sold all his food, he knew this is going to happen. What a shrewd badass."
19,"Oct 28, 2020",Am I the only one that thinks it’s creepy how Dokja smiled when things got bad
19,"Oct 28, 2020","YALL HAVE TO READ THE WEB NOVEL. just gonna say, URIEL BEST GIRL"

19,"Jun 27, 2021","the kid is so cute, pls creator I don't want him to die 🥺"
19,"Oct 28, 2020","Ok, that panel where Dokja was patting Gilyeong's hair was really cute and I almost squealed. I also like the new girl, and considering how much Dokja knows about the story and all the things that are in it, I think she'll become a good companion. (Oof I've been listening to NCT way too much. I almost spelled Gilyeong like Doyoung lol)"
19,"Oct 28, 2020",i like huiwon
19,"Oct 28, 2020",The secretive plotter is the best! (Still wondering who he really is even when I know it’s likely a huge spoiler 🤩)

19,"Feb 24, 2021",if our world had people streaming our lives they would be hella disappointed in mine lol
19,"Nov 2, 2020",man I like the kid and Dokja's relationship it reminds me of like an older brother caring for his younger bro. also can I just say that I'm already liking the new girl but who will be the love interest for Dokja?

The constellation [Obessed Procrastinating Teen] might have a crush on Dokja. "
19,"Oct 28, 2020",the second the creator of this story creates and releases dokkaebi plush dolls as merch I'm buying them all 😍
19,"Oct 28, 2020","So basically, living in a world controlled by Dokkaebai is cheaper than living in America. Cool, sign me up for the apocalypse. Worst comes to worst, I die, but at least I die in a really cool and dramatic way."

And now trying to survive without food and with survival fee of 100 coins?? I'd rather take some looooong nap that calculating things and stress out :)"
19,"Oct 30, 2020",That pocky poke is probably the most wholesome thing I've seen in this comic so far.
19,"Oct 29, 2020","Don’t forget this man has read the book, that’s why he advised his friends to eat all the food right away and sold everything to gain an insane amount of coins. "
19,"Oct 28, 2020","New (possibly) important character, Dokja hoarding coins for the next scenario, great episode"

19,"Oct 28, 2020","Another awesome chapter! Dokja's brain is expanding exponentially, Huiwon is a much more interesting character than I thought she would be, and Gilyeong is adorable."

19,"Feb 27, 2021","My boi Dokja be so smart. It's so fun seeing Inho's disappointed face. Lol they're relieved why would they think Dokja is an idiot though? Woah it looks like the person Dokja rescued is quite bold, she can be a good main character. It looks like the kid Gilyeong Lee is more awesome than we thought. LMAO Huiwon is getting trust issues and thinks Dokja is sus. She has some really good stats and have limitless potential, guess she's really a main character now more than Sangah and Hyeonseong."

Good job, Dokja. "
19,"Oct 29, 2020","he didn't try to rape her, he did rape her. "
19,"Oct 28, 2020",interesting how they changed some of the discriptions of this episode. they ended up making less extreme statements. in the novel dokja asked her if she stops them will she pay for food for them. will she take responsibility if they die of starvation?
19,"Oct 28, 2020",I gotta admit... This is the BEST COMIC in History 👍😃 I really hope that they get to make this an anime series... This is an incredible experience to be able to read this.... So excited!! 🎉🎊🎉😁😁😁
19,"Oct 28, 2020",original dokkaebi's getting spanked
19,"Oct 28, 2020",I didn't see it coming... That's Dokja for you! He prepared everything from the moment he entered the scenario! That man is amazing

19,"Oct 28, 2020","Sooooo... Basically Taxes? Guys, THESE OUT-OF-WORLD-ALIEN KNOWS TAXES!"

19,"Apr 2, 2021","poor baby, I forgot his name but he is the sweetest, giving food to Dokja. Hes gonna be so strong I just know it"
19,"Mar 18, 2021",as a collective the group should've been working towards completing the scenario with the strongest leading the charge. that leader should've used the incite skill to encourage cooperation and productivity but typical of a selfish asshole he used it to be a villain. how cliche
19,"Feb 11, 2021",she is a demon slayer?? wow
19,"Jan 19, 2021",okay but bihyeong is being disciplined? WHY?

After all in this world, as long as you have enough coins and spend them astutely, you can survive any situation. If you have no coins, no matter how strong you currently are, and how prudently and astutely you act, you will eventually die. Because you can't avoid scenarios, and those will only become harder."

I mean he hasn’t even met this new dokkaebi so how could he have known? I’m confused but very pleased nonetheless. He has a lot of coins and his group isn’t going hungry anytime soon 👍🏻

19,"May 5, 2021",Am I yhe only one thingking that this girl might be the last one standing alive in the end. It's because our main hero (Dokja) isn't supposed to be existing there and the protagonist of the novel who was incarnated a times before can actually change the flow of the events. Like the no. of survivors in cabin and the leaving of the protagonist in the station. And the survival of this girl who was supposed to die but got saved by our hero so the natural flow of events got disturbed.
19,"May 1, 2021",I am also relieved that Dokja isn't an idiot

And, ashamed Hyunsung was also cute! "

19,"Oct 21, 2020",I have a feeling the secretive plotter is one of the stronger constellations but Dokja didn't read into it because the secretive plotter might even have the ability to rewrite the plot hence the name secretive plotter.

19,"Oct 21, 2020",Remember when Dokja said he was the only one who knows the ending of TWSA? What if he runs into the people read the beginning of TWSA but dropped out? Would the scenarios or survival rates go up because they also read the beginning?

19,"Oct 28, 2020",so this is a more I want to say storyline question but because dokja has a stream star contract does that mean because he's in the channel the contract will be in place till or because we have a new administrator the contract null for now
19,"Oct 28, 2020","omg, I love that kid, he's so precious. I WOULD DIE FOR HIM. also, Dokja is fine af and no one can tell me otherwise, like, DID YOU SEE THAT SMIRK"

19,"Oct 22, 2020","1) Gilyoung is so precious 🥺. 2) I like Huiwon, we love a strong female lead. 3) I wonder if Bihying got caught for making the contract or maybe the constellations complained about how he kept turning off the channel. 4. It seems like the dokkaebi are the lower class of the magical beings... they’re all dressed in rags like they’re poor. 4) the food problem is gone so the major group will lose power. & w/ the extra coins Dokja can help his team if they run out for the fee"

19,"Oct 14, 2020",Anyone else read the novel before this chapter? I had to verify because my memory could have been wrong. But the timing of the events is slightly different in the novel. He mention to his friend that he will charge them before the event where he tells the crowd he will charge them for food. It isn't a big deal but the way it is in the novel does make him seem like less of an hypocrite or he might have predicted this would happen. In this version it seems like charging his friend is a reaction.
