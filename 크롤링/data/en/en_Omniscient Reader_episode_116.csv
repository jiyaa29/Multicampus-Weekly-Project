Episode,Date,Review
116,"Aug 3, 2022","What a chapter man...we get Persephone looking like Sangah (and hot af might I add), we got her licking her lips, her having gold eyes, and we find out that there are still things even he doesn't know. That begs the question...does that mean even the author doesn't know EVERYTHING and just wrote about things they DO know in order to help the reader (Dokja)? "
116,"Aug 3, 2022",Ohhh ■■■■ is starting! Things are gonna get exciting. Edit : Happy Birthday Yoo Joonghyuk🥳❤

116,"Aug 3, 2022","ANOTHER BLUSHING KIM DOKJA, AND THIS TIME WITH SWEAT DROPS. THANK YOU ONCE AGAIN, LORD SLEEPY-C FOR DRAWING DOKJA LIKE THE PRETTY BOY HE IS"
116,"Aug 3, 2022","so I guess he's changed the story so much that the world of the book no longer exist and is now more like a compass and map. it points and shows his world, but no longer gives him infinite knowledge over everything covered in the map"
116,"Aug 3, 2022","If anyone still doesn't get it, Kim Dokja has a certain fetish hehe"
116,"Aug 3, 2022","WHY MUST THE WEBTOON CLOSE IN ON NAMWOON WHEN PERSEPHONE SAID THAT THE DEAD CANNOT BE REVIVED, WHY MUST YOU HURT ME LIKE THIS"

116,"Aug 3, 2022","[Constellation ""Dragon of the Peach Tree"" is surprised to know the reader of the entire novel doesn't have every ounce of information. 5 coins have been sponsored.]"
116,"Aug 4, 2022","i see many comments said it's because Dokja changed the story so much. keep in mind that TWSA is 3000+ chapters and it contains YJH's rounds of regression. that means YJH repeated the scenarios sooo many times, and there's so much variations of clearing the scenarios and a very broad knowledge to the world itself. So yes, Dokja obviously changed things in this 3rd round, but what he did is just another variation (let's say it's what YJH from the novel did in his 8th round,13rd, or else)."
116,"Aug 3, 2022",And that's when Dokja realized he just might've bitten off more than he can chew
116,"Aug 3, 2022","She is like a tiger in a cage telling the man with the key to open it showing off her beautiful stripes , showing how strong he will be when he has her claws , and piercing his soul with those golden ringed eyes knowing all he has to do is turn the key "

116,"Aug 3, 2022",A pretty clever way of Persephone to find out the true nature of Dokja.
116,"Aug 9, 2022",Finished the novel today. Started the novel on May 19 2021. I didn't really think I would take one year to finish the novel but it was really a great journey! I enjoyed every bit of the story like a constellation lol. But it was really great. Thank you author-nim for creating such a story. I loved it to the very end ❤
116,"Aug 3, 2022","considering he'a changed the story to the point where he is in the 5th scenario, who knows how much a character he saved in the first episode will change the futur and events in the next days"
116,"Aug 3, 2022",oh buddy... you got a big storm coming..... so glad we're getting to the real meat of the story *crowd laughs*
116,"Aug 3, 2022",if you notice how dokja says that stories arent linear than that could imply dokja wrote a story to his past self in hopes of improving him in the future?
116,"Aug 3, 2022","Dokja's ■■■■? If persephone was refering to that here, explains why it looks filtered"
116,"Aug 3, 2022",I was told this chapter would exist. I was correctly informed: it's spectacular. 
116,"Sep 7, 2022","""What is a Soul? A miserable little pile of Stories!"""
116,"Sep 7, 2022",the beginning of Kim Dokja/Chinese Dress and Garter Belt
116,"Sep 7, 2022","orv certainly knows how to build suspense and fear. despite having read this in the novel already, chills went down my spine when Persephone said ""it's their story"". entire lives and experiences and memories reduced to meat for the enjoyment of the constellations. it makes you hate the constellations even more. and the censor, man. dokja realising that there's more to this world than he thought hits so hard. genuine kudos to the artists for the art this chapter (honestly, for all of them) "
116,"Sep 7, 2022",The Constellations are story fanatics who support their favorites by throwing coins at them. Why do I feel called out?
116,"Aug 3, 2022",my dumbass would've absolutely eaten that food 
116,"Sep 7, 2022","Kind of Arrogant of Dokja to assume that he knows everything within the universe of TWSA when he didn't even write the story to begin with. TWSA was GIVEN to him. The only natural question, then, should be ""By whom?"" Because he STILL has no clue who the author is by this point, and he definitely shouldn't assume that the author is the only power player above the constellations."

116,"Aug 3, 2022",What's your guys story food? I'd be junk food.
116,"Aug 3, 2022","spending the money to buy coins, reading 6 chapters in a row like a lore maniac, running into the wall that is the end of content for the week. regret? I HAVE NON! WHAT A FREAKING CHAPTER LADIES AND GENTELMAN!!!"
116,"Sep 8, 2022","ok, I have to give props to the artist, That might be Sangahs face and figure but not for a second did I think it was her. It was even a slightly different tone of voice in my head if that makes sense. Amazing work!"
116,"Aug 3, 2022",F▪️▪️K…. She beautiful 🤤
116,"Aug 3, 2022",When the Omniscient Reader realizes he is no long omniscient.
116,"Sep 7, 2022",Not so omniscient reader
116,"Aug 3, 2022",Huh so there's parts of the TWSO lore he doesn't know. I guess that means that the author didn't get to cover some important things. 
116,"Sep 7, 2022","""those who devour stories and love stories the most"" The readers start to sweat"
116,"Aug 4, 2022","The more I read, the more I'm certain we've seen TWSA's writer already"
116,"Aug 3, 2022",Dokja realizing that this story goes.much further than the book. Especially with him derailing it.
116,"Aug 3, 2022","There is always a point in Fanfics that when a reader goes into a world they are familiar with there is what I call a tipping point, where all there efforts to change the plot take effect, but at the cost of them losing the information that would happen and be replaced by something else. Maybe this isn’t what is happening but I maybe it is. Idk, but I will keep reading to find out."
116,"Sep 7, 2022",“those who devour stories and are story fanatics… the true nature of the constellations” …a bit ironic as the sole reader TWSA
116,"Aug 3, 2022",I'm so glad that they finally use '■' for the filtering 😭
116,"Sep 7, 2022","So what Dokja’s probably experiencing is when an author sets up a plot device mid story, but moves on & forgets to address it or explain it entirely. Parts of TWSA were incomplete. That’s probably why so many people dropped it. Sometimes you notice it as a reader, or you forget the author was even trying to set up something to begin with cause it wasn’t explained. That’s why he doesn’t have all the info even though he read the story- cause it was never given to the readers in the first place 😮"
116,"Aug 4, 2022",I am actually glad that there is missing information. Keeps things spicy.
116,"Aug 3, 2022",I wonder if he would get slashing skills from that steak (Not stabbing because that one is still alive)
116,"Sep 8, 2022","Oh my gosh. I got chills reading this chapter from just how beautiful it was. The art is always extremely well-done and the backgrounds have been some of the best I've seen, but this chaoter especially is amazing, and the pacing and suspence and use of color even more. But the biggest chills I got was reading that Dokja doesn't even know everything."
116,"Aug 4, 2022","[Constellation, Horn of the Ram, is shocked that Incarnation Dokja doesnt know about ■■■.]"
116,"Sep 8, 2022",Now I understand how TWSA lost its readers.
116,"Sep 7, 2022","Wait. In that panel after the grayscaling, is he looking at persephones speech bubble? He truly is a reader. "
116,"Sep 7, 2022",so people gonna gloss over the 12 page description on how delicious the sou~~ erm food is?
116,"Aug 17, 2022","**slight spoiler**                                                                     persephone as sangah: “you need to cope with what’s already passed” oh god the foreshadowing,,"
116,"Aug 4, 2022","oh shit, SP is pondering now!"
116,"Sep 8, 2022","We have finally reached this point of the story where he meets Persephone. I absolutely loved this scene with how it was drawn and described :) Though what I was most happy abt is… the FACT THEY USED THE TERM “STORY” instead of “fable”, which I hadn’t heard in a long time in the English translation. Made me feel happy :D"
116,"Sep 8, 2022",How did the author write 12 pages about the taste of one single mea?!?
116,"Sep 7, 2022","those ""■■■■"" people want to know so bad and im part of that"
116,"Sep 7, 2022","He didn't need to remember TWSA to know not to eat food in the underworld, he just needed to remember Persephone's story about the pomegranate smh"
116,"Sep 7, 2022","I know this isn’t a Greek mythology comic, but I love how Persephone is portrayed here. The goddess of death and the underworld should be scary, and complex, and seductive 👏 love it 👏 "
116,"Sep 7, 2022","I love the Underworld arc. It's where the plot starts to thicken, in my opinion. Also, we get Persephone as Sangah - that in itself is a huge bonus~ "
116,"Sep 7, 2022","What is a man? Just a miserable pile of stories.
Not too surprised there’s something Dokja doesn’t know. Even with a story as drawn out as TWSA, there’s gotta be a few things that the author thought up but didn’t put into the published story."
116,"Sep 7, 2022","Dokya, DUDE... YOU'VE BEEN CHANGING THE STORY. Your knowledge is only gonna get you so far once those scenarios run out. because they can just add more, and then you'll be up the creek without a paddle."
116,"Sep 7, 2022","""Just as I thought, God's ass is...."""
116,"Aug 3, 2022",i see that blush Dokja 😏
116,"Aug 3, 2022","HOLY HECKKK. THERE IT IS COMRADES, OUR VERY FIRST CENSORSHIP! I STILL GET GOOSEBUMPS EVERY SINGLE TIME"
116,"Aug 3, 2022","Not so omniscient now, are we Dokja 😏"
116,"Sep 8, 2022","ah, when the world is bigger than the book"
116,"Sep 8, 2022","It probably means information from that universe that were just not published in the novel. There mist have many, many things that exists that wouldn't all fit in it."
116,"Sep 7, 2022",NOO I CAUGHT UP 😭😭I WANTED TO READ MORE😭😭😭
116,"Sep 7, 2022",Looks like Dokja found a spoiler ~
116,"Sep 7, 2022",I WILL NEVER GET TIRED OF SEEIG DOKJAS FLUSHED FACE
116,"Aug 9, 2022",I love this webtoon with a burning passion 
116,"Aug 7, 2022","Aw man. I thought Secretive Plotter was future Dokja. Guess I have to read the whole story again to come up with more theories. oh no, poor me"
116,"Aug 6, 2022",Well... crap.
116,"Aug 4, 2022",Authors not knowing everything that happens in their stories confirmed. THERE IS ALWAYS SO MUCH INFORMATION LOST IN THE MARGINS AAA Dokja you really shouldn't be surprised by this 🤣
116,"Aug 3, 2022","HAPPY BIRTHDAY YOO JOONGHYUK MY LOVEEEEEEE ♡W♡ ✨
Ok, I've always pondered what Dokja meant with that ""Time doesn't only move forward, thought you would know""... i couldn't find to which part of Persephone's myth it could refer to, anyone knows?

Also, there's a LOT of foreshadowing in ORV and I had forgotten Persephone said that here and Dokja didn't know the info yet, IDK what that is all about but I'm pretty sure the answer is in the future (and it might be one of those things that hurt my ♡)"
116,"Aug 3, 2022",Can we all just take a moment to appreciate this Webtoon? Thanks Singnsong and Sleepy-c!!!!! Don’t forget to like the chapter!
116,"Sep 8, 2022",it's so funny when you know the reason behind the dokja's blushing 
116,"Sep 8, 2022",As a vegetarian the soul meat is disturbing in many levels 
116,"Sep 8, 2022",*sigh* here goes another clueless dokja screenshot in the album 
116,"Sep 7, 2022",Persephone looking sangah is so hot I gasped the whole chapter 
116,"Sep 7, 2022",I think future Dokja or future Junghyeok is the author of TWSA. 
116,"Sep 7, 2022","""no exeptions""you say that to a guy who already revived twice
heck thers some incarnations who know he can do that
how are you a god and dont know? did you really just ignore everything up until now?"
116,"Sep 7, 2022",I love it when Dokja is in trouble. It keeps things interesting. He does know a lot since he is the Omniscent Reader but doesn't mean he didn't overlooked something. 
116,"Sep 7, 2022","My friend told me I should read the web novel before finishing the webtoon, but I kind of like this comic format so idk 🤔"
116,"Sep 7, 2022",Boobas
116,"Sep 7, 2022","Any novel readers in the comments ready for the future? I'm kinda not, but there's some interesting stuff up ahead... (Saying spoilers to respond is NOT needed)"
116,"Aug 4, 2022",I hate being caught up 
116,"Aug 3, 2022",huh. I definitely read this part in the novel but I forgot about that filter detail. and the constellations clearly know about what persephone just said 
116,"Aug 3, 2022","[The constellation ""The Red King"" is amused by Incarnation Dokja Kim's newfound lack of information.  1050 coins have been sponsored.]"
116,"Aug 3, 2022",damn this is gonna shake him up a little bit and us lol the twsa author is probably adding more to the novel as its a reality or its known information that he's going to have to dig deep on.
116,"Sep 9, 2022",How does she know so much about Korean men? Well she's been watching too much kdrama before the scenarios started ofc. Stories are still stories. And kdramas got a huge variety 
116,"Sep 8, 2022","So TWSA is someone's (presumably the [Secretive Plotter]'s ""story""? And Dokja reading the webnovel was him consuming it?"
116,"Sep 8, 2022",What? Wow even Dokja isn’t aware of everything in the novel he has consistently read! This was a dope chapter 👍🔥
116,"Sep 8, 2022",I have a Theorie: The Autor of TWSA is someone who also was in the TWSA storie and after he got out of there he wrote evrything down what he knows
116,"Sep 7, 2022",Omg. Some thirsty people are spilling out in the comments. 😂
116,"Sep 7, 2022",Finally! The ■■■ of ■■■ is starting!
116,"Sep 7, 2022",THIS IS SO INTERESTING GODDAMN 😩😩😩
116,"Sep 7, 2022",good lawd ik thats persephone. BUT SHE SO FUCKJNG FINE HAVE MERCY
116,"Sep 7, 2022","I got goosebumps. Now I wanna know, who is the author???"
116,"Sep 7, 2022",Now that's interesting! I wasn't expecting anything would be censored to Dokja. Maybe there are short stories connected to TWSA that Dokja never discovered and thereby didn't read?
116,"Aug 4, 2022",Well I’m screwed. I watched all the free pass episodes and I’m out of money. See ya when I see ya.
116,"Aug 3, 2022","Well duh, by changing the outcome of the scenarios you created new ones that didn’t exist in the novel. You knew this when you destroyed the throne you 백치"
116,"Aug 3, 2022",mommy
116,"Sep 7, 2022","""What is a man? A miserable little pile of stories."" Really, I thought man was a miserable little pile of secrets."
116,"Sep 11, 2022","the boxes have started its appearance, the plot thickens everyone 🧍"
116,"Sep 10, 2022","I mean, it makes sense there would be things he doesn't know; no matter how long a story is, there's no way it could truly encompass every minutiae in the world"
116,"Sep 9, 2022",He may have read the whole story. But that story was still limited to JungHyeok's perspective...
116,"Sep 8, 2022",AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO DON'T STOP NOWWWW I NEED ALL THE EPISODES!!!!! AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
116,"Sep 8, 2022",DOKJA BLUSHING
116,"Sep 8, 2022",dokja be having some identity crisis lmaooo 😭😭
116,"Sep 8, 2022","ye, cool, but like...DOKJA BLUSHING, DOKJA BLUSHING, DOKJA BLUSHING😳😳😳"
116,"Sep 8, 2022","So if incarnations are meat to be eaten by constellations, is sponsoring one like raising your own cattle? "
116,"Sep 8, 2022",The lore..THE LORE!
116,"Sep 8, 2022",plot twist: the author also plagiarized
116,"Sep 7, 2022","Oh boy we're entering uncharted territory! Up until now Dokja was never truly afraid because of his knowledge of TWSA, but now I wonder how he's going to keep up with the plot twists. At some point his crew will ask him ""Hey Dokja, how do we solve this situation?"", he'll say he doesn't know and everyone loses their minds :v"
116,"Sep 7, 2022",Yoo that blush is telling me something Dokjaa 👀
116,"Sep 7, 2022",So we are like constellations. Hungry for stories.
116,"Sep 7, 2022","12 pages describing how the food taste, wow"
116,"Sep 7, 2022",Not so omniscient now are you kdj 😯
116,"Sep 7, 2022","Persephone as Yoo Sangah just one chance please, I am on my KNEES"
116,"Sep 7, 2022",Is there anyone who ships Dokja & Suyeong? no one? just me? ok
116,"Sep 7, 2022","Mans forgot to read the spin-off WEBTOON, it’s a tough break "
116,"Sep 7, 2022",him having a crush on Sangah gives me life
116,"Sep 7, 2022",Semi-omniscient reader?
116,"Sep 7, 2022","""TWSA describes how delicious it is over 12 pages"" how...? More important, why? How do you get 12 pages out of that? Do I not understand bc I'm a vegetarian? "
116,"Aug 4, 2022",i too hate censorship
116,"Aug 4, 2022","I mean, he read the original novel but he’s changed so much of it that there must be new plots and enemies he can’t know because he created them in this life. What did he think was gonna happen?? 🤷🏻‍♀️"
116,"Aug 4, 2022",Really love the revelation that Dokja doesn’t know everything. An interesting piece of development I wasn’t expecting
116,"Aug 3, 2022","Wow, that end was mind blowing. Also, Sangah!Persephone is incredibly charismatic"
116,"Aug 3, 2022",Come on😩😩😩this chapter was so amazing but it flew by so fast... But I'm really loving Persephone❤️
116,"Aug 3, 2022",Premium beef indeed. But constelations consuming stories in a literal level hits diferent
116,"Sep 18, 2022","btw iirc, he hadnt read the epilogue of twsa right? iirc there was one more chapter, the epilogue which would have been released the day after the notice abt end of series. i think.but even in the novel i dont rmb them ever realing what the epilogue was abt? maybe its not important? but haha it must suck to finish a novel n not read the epilogue so you havent really ""completed"" the novel"
116,"Sep 12, 2022","""What is a man?  A miserable little pile of stories?"" *throws wine glass*"
116,"Sep 12, 2022","It's not often that people make Persephone scary AF, but here we are"
116,"Sep 12, 2022",maybe its a storyline the author was  going to take but switched out... ???
116,"Sep 11, 2022","i love reading these comments especially those who haven't read the novel yet, it's fun to read their theories jfjsjckskf"
116,"Sep 10, 2022","I feel like, I can relate to the constellations. As a reader, I always crave for stories and I think I can't live without these stories TT"
116,"Sep 9, 2022",Queen Elizabeth II is now a constellation.
116,"Sep 9, 2022","Of course there are things that Dokja as a reader would not know. There are things an author does not write in their storys. Things that are ment to be infured instead of explained, things that have been scrapped or altered for the sake of the flow and pacing of a story. Things that happened outside of the character's perspective or happened long before or long after the events of the story. "
116,"Sep 9, 2022",The plot THICKENS!
116,"Sep 9, 2022",Copyright is strong in this universe.
116,"Sep 9, 2022",When i said dokja finally girlbossed too close to the sun last time this WASNT WHAT I MEANT
116,"Sep 8, 2022","Well that's not surprising, the author of TWSA didn't include any info about themselves, yet to be able to write that, they clearly have to be a big shot."
116,"Sep 8, 2022","this is the first time ◼️◼️◼️ is being mentioned, and it's giving me goosebumps."
116,"Sep 8, 2022","You know that's IN the story, Dokja. This is something outside of it."
116,"Sep 8, 2022",Hoooooo-boy. 
116,"Sep 8, 2022",Ok so im kinda lost like I don't understand what is going on but... Dokja blusing?? Yes 🛐🛐
116,"Sep 8, 2022","Oh god there's still things he doesn't know, this is getting juicy akdjakdj"
116,"Sep 8, 2022","Off hand thought, but what if Dokja was the author? With all the, time is not linear stuff, what if this is a sort of loop where dokja becomes the author and this is all a ploy by him to change stuff for a brighter future? Probably not, but it’s an interesting thought."
116,"Sep 7, 2022",How does it feel when you know better than Kim Dokja this time Novel reader/reader that's already known information about this? ⬛⬛⬛😊😉 Tbh​ I'm both sure and not sure but I'm excited to know more
116,"Sep 7, 2022",that's an interesting technique on the Persephone niece myth
116,"Sep 7, 2022","There's always something the author couldn't show. Gotta remember that you don't have every single character's view point and knowledge, no matter how many chapters you read."
116,"Sep 7, 2022","Ok, with the mention of ""SSS grade hunter"", I'm guessing the foods are all reffrences? I just wish i knew to what they were reffrenceing"
116,"Sep 7, 2022","I belive his actions are finally causing real changes to where his knowledge from TWSA will wane. A while back, I thought about much Dokja has changed and that there has to be major ramifications down the road."
116,"Sep 7, 2022",that plot twist thoooo
116,"Sep 7, 2022",Persephone as Sangah and the dress and how she acted 😳 I'd have died there again
116,"Sep 7, 2022","This scene first gives me goosebumps in the novel. Seeing it now in the manhwa, it still gives those feelings."
116,"Sep 7, 2022",I know this is a serious episode but FHSJDHSJ DOKJA BLUSHING BC OF SANGAH SHEEESSH
116,"Sep 7, 2022",Sangah is so pretty with glowing yellow eyes
116,"Sep 7, 2022",Persephone is so unsettling....and what a way to end the chapter
116,"Sep 7, 2022","If this is the case, wouldn't the constellations be waiting to eat dokja's soul?"
116,"Sep 7, 2022","Is it so weird that there's stuffs you don't know? After all you don't know why you ended up in this story, why you have the 4th wall skill. There's def something more going on here and that ""■"" thing is prob linked to this. My theory is the author didn't write about everything that is going on in the story. The constellations and all of that were real and since time doesn't necessarily move forward maybe the author just wrote what would happen to Earth and you read it and it changed the story."
116,"Sep 7, 2022",not dokja asking to look at the old lady he watched die a horrible death instead of sanghah just cause she's in a hotter outfit LOLL
116,"Sep 7, 2022","Theory: Remember the girl who supposedly plagiarized TWSA? Maybe she has the info on the scenario, because she technically wrote the entire thing as well. Just slightly differently. Probably means the two books are intertwining."
116,"Sep 7, 2022",translators please. “demonic judge of fire????” shes literally an angel. demon-like is demon-like for a reason. …this was explained in chapter 2. 
116,"Sep 7, 2022","My guess is that she just mentioned the author of TWSA... but if that info really was about a future scenario, then that means TWSA has a sequel Dokja doesn't know about "
116,"Sep 7, 2022","Even if it’s 3000 chapters long, I can’t imagine every single little detail would be in there. I mean, Dokja didn’t even know about Huiwon before he met her"
116,"Aug 31, 2022",IM SCREAMING SO HARD THIS IS MY FIRST TIME GETTING 5 COINS AND I DECIDED TO SPEND IT HERE AND IAM SO HAPPY
116,"Aug 7, 2022",Persephone the author??? How would she know something he doesn’t??? I’m so lost now 🤯
116,"Aug 6, 2022",At least I’m not the only one majorly simping for Sangah in these comments LMAO
116,"Aug 3, 2022",dokja for sure gonna steal that food and eat it on the surface since he knows his items are retained.

116,"Sep 12, 2022",can someone spoil it to me i beg
116,"Sep 11, 2022","no because this makes sense, the book has the protagonist as Junghyeok, the whole book of Twsa only explains what the author writes as a setting and Junghyeok's AND other main characters experiences. He wouldn't have known all of the insight's between the constellations. Maybe this would be unlocked if a character of Twsa is in this situation with Dokja"
116,"Sep 11, 2022","Well, to be fair, the creators of TWSA would need to have access to the event to understand it.  "
116,"Sep 11, 2022",we all saw that blush hehe

116,"Sep 9, 2022","Sangah Queen, please whip me for I have harbored indecent thoughts. So let's see, Dokja has read all the book of TWSA but he still doesn't have all the info. This is gonna sound a bit strange but I feel like The author of that book was acting like an ""apostle"" and writing about the events that were to happen as he ""was told by a higher power."" This seems to be the case in my opiniom but I'd like to confirm it. "

And it contrasted SO NICELY with the fun lil plot twists (that kind of make sense in retrospect but that i did not in a million years expect). The art never fails, as always, and i can hardly wait for next week, as always"

116,"Sep 7, 2022","Holy shit! So Persephone knows something that not even Dokja knows, and whatever she said it censored to dokja since there something in the story he might not have known or read about. Could she already knew that dokja is a reader with every prior knowledge of what happened in the scenario stories?"
116,"Sep 7, 2022",I’m somewhat early!!!!  HA HA BOZO’S!
116,"Sep 7, 2022","I feel like I'm reading Lore Piece, wow the bombshells dropped in this chapter"
116,"Sep 7, 2022",RED ALERT! RED ALERT! THERE ARE THINGS HE DOES NOT KNOW! The author must be making new works canon to the original story! I don't see any other way there could be canon lore that Dokja doesn't already know
116,"Sep 7, 2022","I have a theory about the filtered words. The first word ends with 's which means it is most likely a name, specifically the authors name as that is information that even Dokja doesn't know."
116,"Sep 7, 2022",who said theres only 1 author for the entire world that dokja read? maybe theres many unknow author that wrote some other information?
116,"Sep 7, 2022","Obviously a book doesn't say *everything*, that's why some of his party members are not characters mentioned in the book"

116,"Aug 11, 2022","Kim Dokja, hun. MAYBE you don't know about it because it's an information that is not mentioned in twsa. Remember that the focus of that long ass webnovel is your protagonist YJH, right? In a heavily focused story of a crazed man trynna bulldoze the scenarios, do you think the twsa author gonna care to include a minor character blabbering ■■■■ just bcos?"
116,"Aug 6, 2022",Anyone knows if there’s a web novel for this?
116,"Aug 5, 2022",My thesis: the MC is a regessor and the author of TWSA

Unless, that information has smth to do with the real world..? bc it’s ___’S ___ so maybe it’s pertaining to dokja’s identity or  idk but it’s impossible that the author doesn’t know smth abt the world they wrote"

Is that a Castlevania reference? 😂 Oh so she was being literal when she said a soul is a steak. 😅 I wonder what privileged information Persephone shared. That woman is dangerous. Looks like not everything that exists in the works was chronicled in TWSA, but just Junghyeok's interactions with the world. The story can change as Dokja has shown and it's larger than he imagined. 12 pages describing this? No wonder the readers dropped 😂"
116,"Oct 3, 2022","woah, the persephone i know in this series was way more scary than the persephone i know in lore olympus. btw both series were so🤍🤍"

116,"Sep 10, 2022","Without lifting a finger to attack anyone, Persephone is portrayed as such a beautiful and powerful dangerous being. Really nice depiction of the underworld, and  and fun interpretation of her character. It makes you think that this Persephone probably freely chose to stay in the underworld because she liked/respected Hades on her own terms.  Always cool to see chapters that are very gripping and interesting, when it's just well written dialogue. Reminds me of Jack meeting Beckett in Worlds End."
