Episode,Date,Review
117,"Aug 10, 2022","DOKJA'S COURTING HADES AND NOT PERSEPHONE! 😆 Dokja out here chasing the man instead of the lady, I can already see the signs."
117,"Aug 10, 2022","Did he just become something like...their kid? Their ""champion"" of sorts? Like Hercules to Zeus? Edit: PLEASE KEEP SPOILERS OUT OF THE REPLIES!!!! I'm not a novel reader and I will NOT be a novel reader. Quit fcking spoiling it for the rest of us. it's uncalled for, unnecessary, and rude."
117,"Aug 10, 2022","HAN SOOYOUNG AHHHHHHH. It's been 5 months, 9 days, 22 hours and 0.000288 seconds since I last saw you 😫"

117,"Aug 10, 2022",DOKJA'S JUST TELLING HER THAT HE'S GOING TO BE EVEN MORE DELICIOUS LATER ON 😫 I CAN'T DO THIS ANYMORE
117,"Aug 10, 2022","The sheer level of bad@ssery from Wukong and Uriel, when they were ready to duke it out with Persephone sent chills down my spine. No amount of imagery can top just how awesome those words alone were!"
117,"Aug 10, 2022","considering Persephone seemed to imply Hades wants what Zeus has with Hercules, I think she's setting Dokja up to be an adoptive son for Hades , or something similar to that despite it apparently heralding the end for the constellations (again, just another guess)"
117,"Aug 10, 2022","WHEN HADES HUG PERSEPHONE, MY HEART GO DJHDJAKSHSJAKA💖💕💓💘💕💓💘💕"
117,"Aug 10, 2022",Have to agree with Persephone... Dokja sure has a way with words. 😎

117,"Aug 10, 2022",So here is the beginning of Dokja's adoption process xd

117,"Aug 10, 2022",add Hades to the list of eager people to be the supporting constellation of Dokja
117,"Aug 10, 2022","DOKJA DOING THE EYE THINGY AGAIN, IF RAT WHY HOT?"
117,"Aug 10, 2022",the snake could definitely be Suyeong. she didn't say anything about it being an animal.  though to be honest it is somewhat a waste to get rid of someone with such a useful ability.
117,"Aug 10, 2022","secret plotter is really just Lucy from Disenchanted ""Do it! Do it! Do it!!"""
117,"Aug 10, 2022",Natsumi might as well be a constellation at this point. They have over taken the top comments!
117,"Aug 10, 2022",Calling it “secretive plotter is Loki “
117,"Aug 10, 2022",DOKJA'S SMIRK! EUGHEGHUHUEHGUHEUHUEH *dies*
117,"Sep 14, 2022","Dokja really said “wow, I’m five steps ahead and she took my bluff, I might get eaten tho” meanwhile Persephone “ I am also bluffing, my real goal is to acquire a son. He is my son now.”"
117,"Aug 10, 2022","Having a representation of Persephone actually acts like a badass queen and goddess who really takes no shit for once was really satisfying. Thanks for the chapter, it was incredible in many many ways"

117,"Aug 10, 2022",YOU HAVE OBTAINED: Parents (x2)

117,"Aug 12, 2022",LMAO IMAGINE TELLING SOMEONE YOU WANT TO COURTSHIP THEIR HUSBAND IN THEIR FACE
117,"Sep 14, 2022",Secretive Plotter is the kind of friend who'd pull out their phone to record their friends having a full-on brawl.
117,"Aug 11, 2022",Anyone else gonna mention the fact that Wukong and Uriel just low key admitted they’re a part of the Dokja Protection squad?
117,"Sep 14, 2022",even if Hades only showed his arm to hug Persephone it felt so sweet and lovely
117,"Aug 15, 2022","Are y'all really going to deny the fact that Dokja courted HADES INSTEAD OF PERSEPHONE. My man may be a opportunistic assh*le, but at the very least he IS NOT STRAIGHT. "

117,"Aug 10, 2022",the panel where hades hugged persephone was cute ♥️♥️♥️
117,"Aug 10, 2022",I DON'T KNOW HOW TO FEEL WITH THIS TENSION OVER HERE
117,"Sep 15, 2022","Okay but why is Persephone me. “Take these away, they’re too bland,” in response to the banquet of stories in front of her. I find myself having the same attitude towards a lot of stories I come across. The most popular, supposed “best” comics and novels all seem cliche and overdone to me now. They used to get me excited, but now everything seems bland. Except this story. This comic is the one that puts me on the edge of my seat every chapter. I look forward to Dokja making good on his promise."
117,"Aug 10, 2022",lol Husband giving a shadow hug
117,"Aug 17, 2022",i mean if dokja is trying to disprove allegations of his homosexuality i would say that he is failing spectacularly 
117,"Sep 14, 2022","Secretive Plotter in the back encouraging the chaos like, “do it, fight fight fight!”"
117,"Aug 11, 2022","you know, with Hades and Persephone looking to make Dokja something like their son, I wonder if he'll have the name Zagreus added to either his name or constellation nickname "
117,"Aug 10, 2022",My boy Prisoner of The Golden Headband doesn't play. Weak incarnation? Ryu Bang has something to say about THAT.

117,"Sep 14, 2022","After reading Lore Olympus for so long seeing this depiction of Persephone was absolutely scary. 😆Really well done though, I think it was a great depiction of the Queen of The Underworld. And I really like that you showed the loving aspect of their relationship. "
117,"Sep 14, 2022",Dokja: appears / Hades: you take care of this darling 🏃‍♂️
117,"Sep 14, 2022","Imagine being such a big deal, the freaking CONSTELLATIONS take up their weapons to defend you... and the freaking God of the Underworld literally wants you to be his son... "

117,"Sep 14, 2022","She's not asking him to kill Suyeong, is she? She has many heads like their fabled serpent. Or maybe ""severed head"" is a metaphor. This entire chapter gave me chills, and the story and art NEVER disappoint. Can't believe both Persephone and Dokja were both nervous-bluffing their way through. He made a god SWEAT!"
117,"Sep 14, 2022","""I can create a story unlike any you know. One that keeps you on your toes at all times"" this is SO meta haha I've been studying ORV for my own writing since I finished it in 2020"
117,"Sep 14, 2022","We are Hades and Persephone, dining on his story"
117,"Sep 14, 2022",I kinda love the idea of Hades being an introvert that doesn't show himself
117,"Sep 14, 2022","This whole conversation made me feel like I was one of the constellations, being intrigued by every one of their teasing sale pitches"
117,"Sep 14, 2022",kdj adoption soon lmao
117,"Sep 14, 2022",I really have no idea to the novel version (maybe a little bit spoilers but I'm not even sure if that's a genuine spoiler) but why I'm feeling excited to broke my heart in to pieces by the end of this webtoon? 
117,"Sep 14, 2022",Constellation Demonic Judge Of Fire says You Shouldn't Cheat On Junghyeok With Hades.
117,"Sep 14, 2022",dokja explaining to persephone why she shouldn't eat him is me explaining to people why orv is peak fiction. this is coming from someone who's read the entire novel. 
117,"Aug 12, 2022","[Secretive Plotter has taken interest over the recent happenings]
[Secretive Plotter awaits for how this story will turn out]"

117,"Sep 15, 2022","Even at Dokja's darkest moments, he can always count on his three most faithful subscribers to back him up. Just like in the stories of Journey To The West."

117,"Sep 14, 2022","Bet some of yall zoomed in a bit to see Persephone’s THIGHs and aw the way she called Hades her Introvert Darling Husband was cute along with damn, Day 1 Constellations Uriel/Demonic Judge of Fire and Sun Wukong/Prisoner of the Golden Headband willing to fight Persephone if she tried to eat Dokja is the real squad goals "
117,"Sep 13, 2022",wukong and uriel just went try us bitch you won't. I love it XD 🤣
117,"Aug 15, 2022",I bet the serpent she wants might be jormangandr
117,"Aug 10, 2022","don't forget that dokja Co firmed there are gods who are ranked above feed despite fabled being the highest rank officially. and they're are consitlatuons we  ow know that rank even higher the persephone based on the knowledge we can now assume any and all mythos. heavens & helps and all the I between are real they're basically each ""gods"" realm.  so now I think we can to some ""text to world"" estimated on which constilatuons are strong. "
117,"Aug 10, 2022","Move over Dokja, it’s my turn 😩🤚"
117,"Sep 14, 2022","Dokja really winning over all the men 😳 Also persephone being the seductive extroverted one who gets shit done (and whatever she wants) commanding her people with hades shyly in the shadows observing is such a cute pair. He wants things done, and she gets them done, perfect pair.And as others have stated it’s insane how many constellations will risk their lives to defend Dokja, a few is no threat to someone like Persephone but the sheer number and power of each standing up made her nervous"
117,"Aug 10, 2022","Thank you for the godly angles of Persephone, Lord Sleepy-C 🛐🛐"
117,"Sep 16, 2022",Secretuve Plotter is my favorite character because hes literally one of the only constellation that always sides with our MC

117,"Sep 19, 2022","Just got caught up to this episode over the past 4 days, amazing webtoon"
117,"Sep 18, 2022",Why do I feel like dokja about to get adopted into Hades and Persephone's family...?
117,"Sep 16, 2022","Imagine at the end of this series, the author reveals to Dokja that he himself is in another WEBTOON, the one that we are reading. "
117,"Sep 16, 2022","Wait, serpent as in snake? As in traitor? Was that what Persephone’s screen was alluding to? Or was it an actual serpent? 😅"
117,"Sep 16, 2022","tbh I feel like if dokja keeps at it, he could become a constellation "
117,"Sep 16, 2022","I can't wait to see what story that ""child"" will show me either, but since I'm broke i have to wait patiently."
117,"Sep 15, 2022","I'm certain and don't even care if I'm wrong, Wukong would destroy Persephone. He's always been my favourite anyway, even outside of the webtoon"
117,"Sep 15, 2022",Secretive Plotter: COME ON COME OOON! YOU KNOW YOU WANT TO DO IT! COME OOOOON!!!
117,"Sep 15, 2022",The artist seems to be a fellow thigh enjoyer
117,"Sep 15, 2022",the constellations out here protecting him I love it 😭
117,"Sep 14, 2022",If persephone's got this much dommy mommy energy then I can only imagine hades.
117,"Sep 14, 2022","Gosh, one of my top comment got deleted again, and it's the one which I edited to be the epitome of sarcasm and bitterness. WEBTOON is so cruel"
117,"Sep 14, 2022",SUYEONG SUPREMACY

117,"Sep 14, 2022",SUYEONG WHAT’S GOOD!!
117,"Sep 14, 2022","So...This ""snake"" better actually be the giant vine-like tree in that video and not the people. Dokja is gonna lose his Immortal King title if one of them has to be slain, especially since one is a friend and another under his contract! I'm REALLY hoping the snake is an earth elemental or something!"
117,"Sep 14, 2022","""I can't wait to see what story that child will show me"" neither can I "
117,"Sep 14, 2022",forgot to say that last chapter was very important for later part of the story and the concept of stories. 
117,"Aug 15, 2022","[Constellation, LADY OF DODOKJA, smiles upon you. Sub quest ""Read From The Start Again"" is always available to you.]"
117,"Aug 11, 2022",Dokja just stirring up people. The frenzy they make when he acts is amazing.
117,"Aug 11, 2022","so now we know that at least 3 of Dokja simps are stronger than Persephone unless she was talking about Secretive Plotter alone... 🤔😂//// I'm worried about the ""serpent"" thing... I really hope she was talking about a beast that will appear in the next scenario and not about our beloved copycat writer... 😭😭"
117,"Aug 11, 2022",Mommy Persephone and Daddy Hades (/^▽^)/♡
117,"Aug 10, 2022","boy, I sure do hope this aggressive older woman scene doesn't awaken anything in me"
117,"Aug 10, 2022",I was expecting her to lick the sweat that was on her hand
117,"Sep 14, 2022",icb this webtoon about gay people is making me gay for women
117,"Aug 10, 2022","Persephone here looks pretty hot herself, almost good enough to eat with that gaze she gave when she tried to pounce on Dokja. They made her too good here, hopefully we can see more from the one she copied her look from."
117,"Aug 10, 2022","she is fine asf, y'all think so too right?"

He isnt the sort of god who'd ""kill a soul as soon as they step foot into the underworld"" he would turn them away or if they were interesting listen to them and give them a condition/quest to get what they want. its what he's done in many of his myths.

117,"Sep 14, 2022","I have a bad feeling about this snake. The next scenario shows something that looks like a huge branch or a root, reminds me of a certain mythology that has a big tree called Yggdrasil. I remember one particular snake, big enough to circle the whole earth. As much as I'd love to see the Midgard Snake Jörmungandr, I don't want him to die. "

117,"Aug 10, 2022",I LOVE STORY TIME!!!! 😃
117,"Sep 14, 2022",There are many serpents in mythology and the Hydra is one of the most famous ones. I’m guessing that the 6 scenario is going to be Norse themed meaning that the serpent he may kill is Jörmungandr aka the World Snake a child of Loki. It would be a fitting Labor for him to have completed. Perhaps it could be a different serpent for all we know.
117,"Sep 14, 2022",is he going to face medusa? is he covering his eyes because of medusa’s gaze that turns people into stone?
117,"Sep 14, 2022",aww... hades and Persephone #couplegoals XD kissy face kissy face xoxoxoXoOxxxx
