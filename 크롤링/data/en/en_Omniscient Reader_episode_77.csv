Episode,Date,Review
77,"Nov 3, 2021",It’s seems the “main character” and our lovely main character Dokja have finally made an alliance my coins have been spent wisely 😈
77,"Nov 3, 2021",Confirmed that the Demonic Judge of Fire ships Dokja and Junghyeok.
77,"Nov 3, 2021",“You are acting like a wife.”~ Han Su-Yeong 
77,"Nov 3, 2021",they changed it... they changed the wife quote.... gonna cry
77,"Nov 3, 2021",Dokja unlocked a new skill! Malewife 
77,"Nov 3, 2021",demonic judge is hard shipping here and rich enough to fund the ship
77,"Nov 3, 2021",THE WAY BOTH OF THEM JERKED BACKWARDS WHEN YJH OPENED HIS EYES PLS SNHDHDHDHDHD
77,"Nov 3, 2021","oh right in the soup panel with demonic judge of fire’s indirect message spam, the small text next to dokja’s speech bubble should say “she” instead of “he”"
77,"Nov 3, 2021","[The constellation ""Lazy Broke Weeb"" was deeply moved that it spits its drink on the monitor.] [The constellation ""Lazy Broke Weeb"" wanted to sponsor more but cant.] [5 coins have been sponsored. ]"
77,"Nov 3, 2021",Demonic Judge of Fire: now kissss!
77,"Nov 3, 2021",Uriel being the best fan girl in all our hearts.
77,"Nov 3, 2021","in all seriousness, I too wish to be fed by Dokja "
77,"Nov 3, 2021","“I’ll seduce him” Suyeong says, little does she know that Junghyeouk is the gigachad [+5 coins]"
77,"Nov 3, 2021",""" This looks like it will end up killing him """" Well I guess he have to die then.""
Why do I find it so hilarious 😂😂😂"
77,"Nov 3, 2021",I mean..they would make a cute couple. Also wooowww he seriously caught onto him and had them take him to Dokja specifically. They're gonna make great friends
77,"Nov 3, 2021",Kim Dokja is everything - Manipulate Mansplain Malewife
77,"Nov 3, 2021",Something tells me those coins for feeding him was of a different nature than just kindness
77,"Nov 3, 2021","I find it hilarious that the ""main character"" seems to always be passed out somewhere "
77,"Nov 3, 2021",canonically assigned malewife by han suyeong........
77,"Nov 3, 2021",dokja saying he wont let Suyeong feed Junghyeok even if she wants too LMAO alright someone is possessive
77,"Nov 3, 2021",The fact that Suyeong would willingly try to seduce Junhyeok is the strawberry ontop of the cake for me
77,"Nov 3, 2021",Am I the only one to find Bihyeong cute??
77,"Nov 3, 2021",“You two would make a great couple.” Yes. Yes they would. 
77,"Nov 3, 2021",not Dokja and Junghyeok getting shipped by the Demonic Judge of Fire 😭
77,"Nov 3, 2021","Hmm I’d miss it being called [Midday Tryst] but, [Midday Rendezvous] is kinda cool, right?"
77,"Nov 3, 2021","I don't think Dokja could ever decide to kill or let protagonist boy die. He spent so much time wishing he was like him in the past that he's still not fully aware that he's grown a ton as a person caught up in this crazy world. As for Yu, I'm very interested to know how he knows as much as he does about Dokja all of a sudden. I have a feeling that things are going to get even more interesting in the next few chapters. "
77,"Nov 3, 2021",I can sense a bromance forming
77,"Nov 3, 2021",when you try and do all the side quest's to get stronger BUT THAT 1 A-HOLE is speed running the main campaign!!!
77,"Nov 3, 2021","they also changed ""Midday Tryst"" to ""Midday Rendezvous"" 🥲"
77,"Nov 3, 2021",ALSO AT THE END.... IT IS HER!!! OMG!! IM SO EXCITED!!! 
77,"Nov 17, 2021","I just realize but Webtoon did A BIG miss translations yet again! In Jonghyuk character profile, his second stigma is reincarnation when he already had regression. This two was almost the same yet different that why you can't both skill in one person. Regression is for regressor like Jonghyuk and reincarnation for reincarnator. PLS fix this webtoon! It is supposed to be ""Transmission"" a skill that let a regressor get his previous skill. Webtoon keep making mistake here and there 😭"
77,"Nov 8, 2021",god i love hsy and kdj. ultimate asshole friendship. wlw mlm solidarity (hostility). aroallo aroace hostility (solidarity). both tsunderes but different in the most frustrating way possible (kdj: [antagonizes someone nonstop then dies for them with zero hesitation] no one could ever love me // hsy: [absolutely horrible unhinged with one (1) gram of Cares About People] i don’t care about you). add yjh and it’s THREE terrible assholes who never say what they mean. ultimate main character trio tbh
77,"Nov 3, 2021",k but it's so unfair that he looks so good even after getting ultra punched and while he’s unconscious 
77,"Nov 5, 2021","I'm just loving that Bihyeong and Dokja are now developing a pretty decent friendship, right now"
77,"Nov 6, 2021",I am absolutely loving this Dokja and Junghyeok shipping going on
77,"Nov 3, 2021",yoo joonghyuk looks at him with murderous intent but dokja’s just like: :D
77,"Nov 3, 2021","and why are they referring to Uriel as ""he""? "
77,"Dec 2, 2021","Ok but like isn’t it cool that the Writer/Plagiarist, The Reader, and the Protagonist are all here together now. I heard they’re one of the best trio✨"
77,"Nov 3, 2021",“You two would make a great couple.” YOU ARE SO RIGHT
77,"Nov 3, 2021",Dokja did you really expect a thanks? 
77,"Dec 8, 2021",artist-nim went off as always drawing junghyeok so distressed yet so handsome
77,"Nov 3, 2021",KIM DOKJA MALEWIFE
77,"Nov 14, 2021","I truly hope I can complain to webtoon to change the translator, even illegal scanlation have better translation than webtoon. I think those scanlation translator should hired by webtoon. I am sorry since this is kinda rude, I am just tired since Omniscient Reader is top series in the webtoon, but the translation can't give it justice"
77,"Nov 3, 2021",Whoo needs coin farms when all you have to do is spoon feed the guy you knocked out
77,"Nov 3, 2021","You heard it here people, straight from Sooyeong's mouth. :3"

77,"Nov 3, 2021",Ay welcome all new shippers~Come aboard as our captain Uriel launches our ship to eternity 
77,"Nov 3, 2021",The famous spoon-feeding scene is officially here!
77,"Nov 17, 2021",What Dokja be mad about when Sooyoung said she tried to seduce Jonghyuk? Are mad about him or her? 👀 ummm
77,"Nov 3, 2021",and where the hell did hsy get the spoon from?! edit:‼️ mild SPOILER in replies!! ‼️
77,"Nov 3, 2021",Everyone brace yourselves! The shippers are about to let loose!
77,"Nov 3, 2021",This chapter reminded me how SHORT Suyeong Han is.
77,"Nov 11, 2021",Demon-like Judge of Fire representing all of the ORV fandom.

77,"Nov 3, 2021",LEE SEOLHWA!!
77,"Dec 8, 2021","Dokja : ""If he dies, he dies."""
77,"Nov 3, 2021","Omg Uriel, I love you! You're so obvious😂😂😂"
77,"Nov 3, 2021",actually demonic judge of fire sponsoring dokja is just bi and bi solidarity 
77,"Dec 8, 2021","""I'll seduce him"" I doubt that'll work but I wanna see her try, it'll be so funny"
77,"Dec 8, 2021","you know i finished off with the novel and started reading new ones, and after noticing the other novels' males' relationships, i have realized how fruity those fuckers are"
77,"Dec 9, 2021",I just realized that some of the constellations probably still think that Dokja and Junghyeok have a child together. 
77,"Dec 8, 2021","I literally cant choose between novel hsy's ""Your acting like a wife"" quote or webtoon hsy's ""you make a great couple"" quote holy shit"
77,"Dec 6, 2021","""you'll make a great wife"" is all I could think about now 😭😂"
77,"Dec 9, 2021",""" You would make a great couple "" I second that! "
77,"Dec 8, 2021",I love all those weird ingredient names and then there’s just *detox potato*😂
77,"Dec 8, 2021","being gay is expensive, thank the demonic judge of fire for recognising that"
77,"Dec 8, 2021",My new favourite power duo with a “we only tolerate eachother” relationships - Han Su-Yeong and Dokja. Their dynamic and the way they bounce off eachother is so funny to me
77,"Nov 3, 2021",Demonic Judge of Fire probably reads mlm judging by the amount of coins—
77,"Dec 9, 2021","I honestly have never shipped two men so hard together even when reading the best of the BL masterpieces out there, which I do quite often. I think I'm going to be a KDJ×YJH fanfic addict soon enough, too."
77,"Dec 9, 2021","""This looks like it'll end up killing him instead"", ""Then I guess he'll have to die"" LMFAOOO"
77,"Dec 9, 2021",Kim Dokja literally said: I did the beating and I did the healing
77,"Dec 8, 2021","Rest In Peace, dear Sooyoung's wife quote 😞 You shall be remembered by all Joongdok shippers"
77,"Dec 8, 2021","Junghyeok better treasure dokja even if he keeps acting like tsundere...I mean,dokja cares,he cares a lot abt Junghyeok"
77,"Dec 8, 2021","""Act of kindness"", my a**! The Judge of Fire is a hard-core shipper! "
77,"Nov 6, 2021",I really want to see how Suyeong would have tried to seduce Junghyeok. That could only have gone well.
77,"Nov 3, 2021",omg I'm in love with the bromance between dokja and junghyeok
77,"Nov 3, 2021",Demonic Judge of Fire is a Dokja x Junghyeok shipper confirmed
77,"Nov 5, 2021","I really wish there was an indirect message from Secrettive Plotter and the Great Sage Equal Heaven, they will surely say something funny"
77,"Dec 8, 2021","""geez you two would make a great couple"" HAHA THATS WHAT I THOUGHT WHEN HE BLEW ON THE FOOD FOR HIM LOLLL how sweet"
77,"Dec 8, 2021","Now, if the author is going to tease us like this, how am I not supposed to think that they will not be together in the future 👁️👄👁️"
77,"Dec 8, 2021",that part where both kdj and hsy simultaneously back off when yjh suddenly opened his eyes is still hilarious to me
77,"Nov 3, 2021",Anyone else hear BotW cooking music when Dokja made the antidote? Haha
77,"Nov 3, 2021","Dokja and Jeonghkyuk need to be a couple, just sayin"
77,"Dec 9, 2021",THEYRE LIKE A COUPLE-??( DONT GIVE ME IDEAS PLS
77,"Dec 9, 2021","After the npc (lol) told kdj that yjh continuously asked them to take him to kdj, kdj's eyes sparkled and he bought all necessary potions to heal yjh lol. I can see he always has the soft spot for the protagonist ෆ╹ .̮ ╹ෆ"
77,"Dec 8, 2021",Do I see an enemy’s to friends to lovers arc starting???
77,"Dec 8, 2021","i just can't have enough of junghyeok. Everytime i see him, i fall for him. I know Dokja is the MC but sometimes someone outshines him. As someone who finished the novel already, I know how great of a character he is. i just cant help falling for him. That sunfish basta*d is pure love ❤"
77,"Dec 8, 2021",Am I the only one who thinks Dokja is getting cuter day by day gradually? 
77,"Dec 8, 2021",the demonic judge of fire is supportive of you lmfao
77,"Dec 8, 2021",Yeah I really wanna know what would happen to them if he regressed. Do those versions of the people we know disappear? Is Dokja the same in each regression? Has he failed to stop junhyeok from killing himself in previous regressions? I have too many questions now and no coins to help answer them
77,"Dec 8, 2021","Yo webtoon, The Demonic Judge of Fire is a 'she', not a 'he'. (This isn't a spoiler, it was revealed somewhere in the first 10 chapters...)"
77,"Dec 8, 2021",I just finished the novel and now I feel sad and empty 😭😭😭
77,"Nov 3, 2021","I bet he'll be able to learn the [Way of the Wind] when his ability creates a bookmark for Lycaon. Also, the Catastrophe of Questions sounds pretty menacing, im not going to lie 😅"
77,"Nov 3, 2021","[constellation Dokja Kim has unlocked the skills HOUSEWIFE,COOK, and NURSE]"
77,"Jan 3, 2022",welcome to the first episode of yjh being a tsundere 🤝
77,"Dec 16, 2021",JUNGHYEOK COOKING LVL 10??? DAMN PAPI
77,"Dec 16, 2021",now... imagine what would have happened if they hadn't had a spoon...
77,"Dec 15, 2021",it says Junghyeok zaddy has cooking level of 10. I need an episode dedicated to this. 
77,"Dec 9, 2021",“You two would make a great couple” STOP I SAID THE SAME THING RIGHT BEFORE THAT 💀💀💀
77,"Dec 9, 2021",And thus begin one of the frutiest companionship
77,"Nov 3, 2021",Demon-like judge of fire is our shipping/stanning queen. ALL HAIL URIEL!!
77,"Nov 3, 2021","huh. “midday rendezvous” instead of “midday tryst”. is that just a webtoon translators thing, or did they change the actual korean term between the webnovel and the ebook? because that seems like the kind of change singnsong would have made for the ebook version, but webtoon’s translators have updated terms before"
77,"Jan 14, 2022",nah istg dokja keeps flirting with the guy who's supposed to kill him 
77,"Dec 16, 2021",Suyeong and Dokja’s relationship is hilarious 
77,"Dec 11, 2021",The Demon Judge of Fire likes yaoi
77,"Dec 10, 2021",The little glare Junghyeok did at both of em when he woke up😭😭 
77,"Dec 9, 2021",just realized we're probably all garbage tier constellations 
77,"Dec 8, 2021",Demonic Judge of Fire ships them. confirmed.
77,"Dec 8, 2021",he? isnt demic judge of fire supposed tl be arch angel uriel mention way back? so it should be she
77,"Dec 8, 2021",he... he just complained that he didn't have enough coins.... HE BLOODY FRIGGIN RICH! LOL
77,"Dec 8, 2021","Also, thanks Dokja for making me remember how much I miss Huiwon and the gang"
77,"Dec 8, 2021",Guess she was right. He is capable of asking for help. This story is so full of surprises…
77,"Dec 8, 2021","Ugh what is up with Webtoons translators lately?!?!?!?!?!  They can't even stay consistent. In ch 42/43 Junghyeok's 2nd stigma is TRANSMISSION not Reincarnation (which is not an appropriate term for the ability).  It's really sad to see the ""official"" translation become pure & utter trash."
77,"Dec 8, 2021","Ok, spoiler questions time, be warned. 1) Why Dokja is calling Uriel He, when he knows it's a she? 2) Why Jonghuyk has a Reincarnation stigma? He's a Regressor, not a Reincarnator, that's entirely different stigma and sponsor behind it."
77,"Nov 5, 2021",I was really hoping to see more of the love///hate///troll relationship lol. it's the best thing in this webtoon.
77,"Jan 9, 2022",I am so glad me and the constellations are on the same ship 🚢 it's like a cruise line
77,"Jan 3, 2022",“You two would make a great couple” LMAO
77,"Jan 1, 2022","""great couple"" we know we know!!! 😏😌"
77,"Dec 31, 2021",SOMEBODY FINALLY SAID IT!!!! THEY ARE PERFECT FOR EACH OTHER 
77,"Dec 17, 2021",Ok but. Blowing on tea before giving it to your loved one is extremely my shit. Even if it’s weird gross antidote potion. I also would have gifted coins for this scene
77,"Dec 16, 2021","The soup: “This looks like it’ll end up killing him” 
“Then I guess he’ll have to die” 

I LOVE THEM"
77,"Dec 15, 2021",bruh the first time Junghyoek woke up was a literal jumpscare 
77,"Dec 13, 2021","Lol Han Sooyoung is always arrogant, but I’m pretty sure there’s only one person who could seduce Junghyuk 😂. Lol this was one of the funniest scenes. And… prolly the scene where Uriel began to do that 😅. Oh, but Midday Rendezvous is highly useful in ways Telepathy isn’t! Ah… her."
77,"Dec 11, 2021",Uriel is literally paying for Dokja and Joonghyuk to interact. She's the perfect definition of a simp.
77,"Dec 11, 2021",the bromance is just too strong
77,"Dec 10, 2021",And here I am having caught up with this amazing webtoon 😭
77,"Dec 10, 2021",just caught up with this series legit 12 hours straight of reading now I'm just sad I don't have coins to get fast pass
77,"Dec 9, 2021",this ep was so gay i love it
77,"Dec 9, 2021",Can’t believe Dokja is canonically malewife
77,"Dec 9, 2021",Dokja doesn't want to her to seduce Junghyuk neither will he let her feed him. Hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm.
77,"Dec 8, 2021","""Here, I found a spoon"" where? How? Why? Things you never think of in the apocalypse"
77,"Dec 8, 2021",wouldn't be surprised if the Demonic Judge of Fire gives a Million coins to Dokja if he married Junghyeok 
77,"Dec 8, 2021",😆 lmaooo these tsundere's
77,"Dec 8, 2021","""You two would make a great couple""Me:Stop, if you say that the fujoshi community reading this will... *Looks at the comment section*, never mind it's too late."
77,"Dec 8, 2021",...why would you change the lines from the novel into something thats worse than the original? like its not so hard to keep the original meaning of the lines but u just had to change it? there has been many mistranslations / not as good tl in this manhwa but this chapter's ones was one of the worst imo LIKE THE WIFE LINE... WHY WOULD U CHANGE IT????? and also calling uriel a He ?? yea and other chapters using several wrong terms. i dont know anymoreeeee
77,"Dec 8, 2021","""Someone is waking all the catastrophies""""Yeah, that would be my mom."""
77,"Dec 8, 2021","so happy to see bihyeong back, he's such a cute little murderous fella, makes you want to risk it all just for a hug "

77,"Dec 8, 2021",Demonic Judge of Fire is a 'she' man hahaha I remember dokja being shookt when they meet for the fist time
77,"Dec 8, 2021",Is it me or is the Demonic Judge shipping those two a little too hard with all those coins.    Also the seduction idea was hilarious.  
77,"Dec 8, 2021","suyeong: ""you two would make a great couple"" || me who saw the fanart some months ago: ""oh, my sour winter child..."""
77,"Dec 8, 2021",detox potato sounds w o n d e r f u l for late night drinking
77,"Nov 3, 2021",omg finally it's picking up. i can't wait to see those two team up ❤❤
77,"Nov 3, 2021","KDJ: He's gonna kill me after what I didMe: ONE PUNCH!!!

KDJ: Can't you let it go (I don't want to die...?)
Me: tHiS rAt-

Also HSY is the MVP of lines LOL"
77,"Sep 19, 2022",enemies and lovers. my favorite flavor
77,"Mar 6, 2022",Those comments on him being a good couple with him is making me want to ship them sm 
77,"Jan 6, 2022",More like Demonic Judge of 'Ships...
77,"Jan 6, 2022","In one translation, Midday Rendezvous is translated as Midday Tryst. Which I like better…do you want to know why?

77,"Dec 12, 2021",1 - Nah even the constellations ship this 2 - Is that a cult?
77,"Dec 12, 2021","Ahh yes, the married couple. Btw it makes no sense for Dokja to call Uriel a he, when he knows she is a woman "
77,"Dec 11, 2021","I wish I could rate this work a hundred, no, thousands of stars.  Just a like isn't enough to show just how much I love this."

77,"Dec 8, 2021","aww in the fan translation in response to Suyeong's ""I'll seduce him"" Dokja was like ""It's not possible for you"" and she said ""How dare you write me off!!"" instead of ""Am I not good enough?"" 😭😭"
77,"Dec 8, 2021","Ugh, just as I was finally getting use to not having to read comments about shipping Dokja and Jonghyuk like when I was reading the novel..."

77,"Dec 9, 2021",Junghyeok is only level 60? Dokja still has a lot of coins. The way Dokja put Junghyeok on a pedestal made him seem like he would be way more overpowered like level 200 since they revert to level 1 during their fight. Now it seems like he put him on a pedestal cause he wants a ship. I mean the guy has been knocked out three times now. He's been unconscious half the story.
77,"Dec 9, 2021","As someone who read the novel: the Catastrophe of Questions was a headache, but great for Dokja's character development."

77,"Dec 8, 2021","ik this most likely won't happen, but it would be so cool if they did actually get together- I mean, we saw how Dojka feels about Juyeong (is that spelt right??) in that impassioned speech, and idk I just think it would be cool. I realise its unlikely "

77,"Nov 10, 2021",Kiss kiss kiss. This WEBTOON is good at avoiding bad character design for example I was reading a WEBTOON a second ago that had a useless character that just attached to the op guy and did nothing but watch and talk about how big his c@ck was to increase the hype. This is good shit
77,"Nov 8, 2021",Wow I can’t believe I actually ship the main character and the protagonist of the webtoon… 
77,"Nov 5, 2021",I am ten toes down in this Dokja and Junghyeok lovers agenda. Seeing that Junghyeok went all that way to see and inform him shows that he really trusts Dokja. 🥺
77,"Nov 3, 2021",[kdj voice] a couple?? yeah a couple of besties ahahahha- [sounds of hsy doing another murder]

77,"Dec 8, 2021",Of so dokja either has to choose to not do anything b/c he’s already kinda “teamed up” with the woman. Or he has to betray them and help the main character. Or ig he could just talk it out but like ok….

77,"Dec 8, 2021",What if Junghyeok is the author of the story Dokja read? His memory went down to the third regression in the process but now he has Dokja on his team. That'll be quite an interesting take.
77,"Dec 8, 2021",Always a pleasure to meet you Junghyeok 😅
