Episode,Date,Review
32,"Dec 9, 2020",i love the fact that jonghyuk can only be this petty with dokja
32,"Dec 9, 2020",The interactions between Dokja and Gilyeong are too wholesome even if Dokja is a hypocrite. Father figures for the win!
32,"Dec 9, 2020",“I’m not gonna die” *proceeds to die*
32,"Dec 9, 2020","you know, I thought of Dokja as a likeable raging sociopath a few episodes back, but he literally just effectively sacrificed his own safety to keep Gilyeong safe. maybe he's got a ploy, maybe he doesn't. But maybe I need to reconsider my opinion of the guy because no matter what way you spin it, that's a pretty heroic action. To put it another way, I really enjoy the depth of his character. I can't predict him, I hardly trust him, yet I'm constantly rooting for him. This series is really good."
32,"Dec 9, 2020",The Lion the witch and the audacity of this Bit*h 
32,"Dec 9, 2020",I find it interesting that Junghyeok Yu was even willing to take Gileong
32,"Dec 9, 2020",Adults in this story: BuT wHy WoNt YoU hElP mE???? iT's NoT fAir!!!!!Child in the story: you can leave us behind. You'd do a lot better.
32,"Dec 9, 2020","Yu Joonghyuk and Kim Dokja are like a divorced couple with Gilyoung as their child. And little Gilyoung can't belive that his beloved daddy forced him to stay with the insufferable father. I mean, look at Gilyoung's face when Dokja passed him to Joonghyuk"
32,"Dec 9, 2020",I love how dokja is the only guy that can get jongyhuk or however his name is spelled to do anything outside his comfort zone XD.... and this is just a theory but I'm starting to suspect that this might be a new round for him that isnt in the book.
32,"Dec 9, 2020",I love for Daddy Dokja and Baby Gilyeong moments. They give me life.
32,"Dec 9, 2020",I forgot how much of an ass jonghyuk can be 💀
32,"Dec 9, 2020",I love how Dokja replied back “I’m not gonna die” after reading his mind lol
32,"Jan 27, 2021","""Take the kid"" ""Give me the child"" pls are they divorced parents or sum-"
32,"Jan 1, 2021","""... I once read a novel that went to shit because the protagonist did that"", btw he read all the novel🤡"
32,"Dec 9, 2020",atleast he accepted the kid
32,"Dec 9, 2020",The cliffhangers in this novel is deadlier then covid. I dont think my heart can take it.
32,"Dec 9, 2020","Junghyeok Yu will never trust Dokja, this is another test I'm sure of it. But I still can't get over the fact Dokja cares the most about Gilyeong, his new lil brother. "
32,"Jan 6, 2021","Dear translators, Please let the characters use honorifics for each other. And please let LGY call KDJ 'hyung'. I think most of the novel and webtoon readers would be grateful if you do so. I actually love this story. It is very close to me. So, please please let them use honorifics. Thank you."
32,"Dec 9, 2020","please let lgy call kdj ""hyung"" for star stream's sake"
32,"Jan 23, 2021","""I'm definitely not meant to be a protagonist. I'll never be a hero or a savior but... Gilyeong will not die. At least not today."" HOOLLLLLLY SHIT SORRY I CANT HEAR U OVER MY LOUD ASS SOBBING 😭💖 YALL PLZ DOKJA HAS ALWAYS BEEN PRETTY MORALLY GRAY BUT LOOK AT THIS CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT I CAN NOTTTT ALSO HOLY SHIT PLZ THE PLOT TWIST OF JEONGHYUK BEING IN THE GREEN ZONE TOOK ME OUT I WAS NOT PREPAREDDDD THIS WAS SUCH A GOOD CHAPTER AND IT WAS SO WORTH MY LAST COINS 👏🤧💖💋"
32,"Dec 9, 2020","That was the moment for me, when Dokja said that the kid not gonna die. You are my man!"
32,"Dec 10, 2020",can I fast pass the fast pass please...
32,"Jan 27, 2021","in the webnovel, Gilyeong uses ""hyung"" to call Dokja and I know this has something to do with the translation but everytime he calls him hyung it just hits different"
32,"Dec 9, 2020",I have been wrong for damn near every plan of action I've predicted and I love it
32,"Dec 9, 2020","Constellation ""Herald of the Black Dawn"" is choosing not to regret buying coins to spend here. *tossed in another 5 coins*"
32,"Dec 9, 2020",[THE CONSTELLATION WEBTOON READER THROWS A TANTRUM AT THE CLIFF-HANGER AND EAGERLY AWAITS THE NEXT CHAPTER.]
32,"Dec 9, 2020",we all know he isn't going to die with that said I still need to see proof he survived. #PleaseSurviveDokja
32,"Dec 9, 2020",another week of agony...
32,"Jan 27, 2021","""at least take this kid then"" ""give me the child"" = my parents agreeing on custody"
32,"Dec 9, 2020",Awkward moment when you see a new episode of omicient reader and you still have coins but you try hard to resist just to remember you bought those coins for this webtoon anyways
32,"Jan 27, 2021","lmao when Yoo Jonghyuk just chillin on his green zone, had got me"
32,"Jan 27, 2021",Dokja and Jonghyuk acting like parents
32,"Jan 27, 2021",It’s official. Dokja is Gilyeong’s dad. And that’s final. 
32,"Jan 27, 2021",It's wierd how the main character isn't the main character
32,"Jan 27, 2021","As usual, Kim Dokja is suicidal 😅 "
32,"Dec 9, 2020",I just realized that the kid and dokja are the main team because in the prologue there togheter 
32,"Jan 27, 2021","""I'm definitely not meant to be a protagonist"" he says, as the definite protagonist of this story"
32,"Jan 10, 2021",I read the comments and I agree that YJH indeed took the room and Gilyoung because it both helps him to find out more about KDJ(since he can't read him at all) and seperate Gilyoung from KDJ's party so he can talk to him alone later
32,"Jan 27, 2021",Feel sorry for that one dude that got his green zone pulled out from under him by the flying white furball. 
32,"Jan 27, 2021",Sometimes gilyeong says things that make me wonder about what he was like before all of that happened.
32,"Jan 27, 2021",So he said he wouldn’t die because the penalty on the screen didn’t say it was death? Smart. Time for him to scam anther dokkebai.
32,"Jan 27, 2021","They both just like protect the cinnamon roll at all costs. ""Take the kid."" ""Give me the child."" Ha haaaa! That was so funny."
32,"Jan 27, 2021",Dokja really only shows his true feelings when he's pissed at Junghyeok
32,"Jan 28, 2021","As much as I love how petty Dokja and Junghyuk are with each other, it was kinda nice to see them both agree to keep Gilyeong safe"
32,"Jan 27, 2021",I gonna riot if that kid dies that is practically his son at this point 
32,"Jan 27, 2021","sure both dokja and junghyeok can be petty narcissists, but at least they're good to best boy gilyeong"
32,"Jan 27, 2021",Safe zones are green. Some of the monsters have green eyes. Conclusion: poke em in the eyes
32,"Jan 27, 2021",Ah yes. Dokja and his self sacrificing sht again- Is he ever going to stop I swear-
32,"Jan 27, 2021","Out of the webtoons here, personally this has the best anime potential.. i haven't been able to predict sht since this dropped"
32,"Jan 30, 2021","I love how honest he is about himself because that's how humans are. Like he's not a villain or hero and he doesn't claim nor act like one. He tries to preserve himself, but also realize he has bonded with his group so he doesn't want them to die either. Also Gilyeong is very perceptive it's scary because he knows that Dokja can get places faster without the group, but honestly yeah that may be true but he would never get far without them."
32,"Jan 27, 2021","""With great power comes the great urge to do petty shit"" -some dude in the webtoon comment section"
32,"Jan 30, 2021",I want the battery his phone has.
32,"Jan 29, 2021","Dokja's relationship with Gilyeong is so wholesome. No matter what you can say about Dokja, you can't ignore how amazing he is for taking Gilyeong in, not ditching him, and keeping the kid safe even if it means it might kill him in the process."
32,"Jan 28, 2021","I can’t tell if Gilyeong is naturally a logical and level-headed person or if the trauma of this whole apocalyptic world has made him cut off his emotions, but either way I absolutely love his character. There are many stories with a girl or kid who’s hella annoying and in general a huge burden but stays for the obvious reason that they’re cute or whatever. However Gilyeong is a rare treasure, he understands things that many of the others don’t, and he tries his hardest to be helpful to Dokja."
32,"Jan 27, 2021",Omg their father-son relationship is gonna make my heart burst ❤️❤️❤️
32,"Jan 22, 2021",when you get touched with how the will dokja protect gilyoung but then suddenly tear up to see how jerk jonghyuk make dokja have to suffer again after thrown up inside monster before 😫
32,"Dec 9, 2020",I straight up paused my anime binging (2nd season hoping there's a third this is freaking amazing) to come straight hereand there's already almost a 100 of you... stay vigilant you brave comic warriors. 
32,"Jan 27, 2021","Ok but like, low blow man. He’s with a kid in his arms, I realize he’s annoying but maybe pick another time?? "
32,"Jan 29, 2021","""I'm definitely not meant to be a protagonist"" said the protagonist"
32,"Jan 28, 2021",Dokja: Ima come back and spit on your shoes.
32,"Jan 28, 2021",dokja has the most strangest personality i’ve ever seen from a webtoon
32,"Jan 27, 2021",Dokja and Gilyeong's interactions makes my heart soft 🥺 Gilyeong looks up to Dokja so much. And Dokja stops at nothing to protect him 🥺
32,"Jan 27, 2021","....I think his chapter douse a lot to show us Dokja mindset more. That yes, he can do this alone...but in a way, he doesn't want to.  HE wants to keep at least some people close to him. He is trying to learn from the mistakes Jonghyuk. He is trying to be better. He is trying to stay 'human' in his own way."
32,"Jan 28, 2021","Jonghyuk changed his fate out of pettiness, that’s what amazing writing is 👌"
32,"Jan 27, 2021",DOKJA IS JUST A SINGLE DAD TRYING TO RAISE HIS 10YO KID 
32,"Jan 27, 2021","So, Dokja read his mind and said, ""I'm not gonna die."" Won't that make this already perturbed person even more cautious?"
32,"Jan 21, 2021","I know many other people have said this before, and I’m going to join right in. I love Gilyeong and Dokja’s relationship 😌 It reminds me of a little brother and big brother dynamic. And seeing Gilyeong hide behind Dokja and Dokja ruffling his hair 😭"
32,"Jan 27, 2021",he'll be fineee plot armor am I right *sweats nervously*
32,"Jan 28, 2021","Dokja after this please adopt Gilyeong! Also I'm glad that Jonghyuk took Gilyeong, but Dokja if you die I'll haunt you for eternity and I'm not kidding so don't try it"
32,"Jan 27, 2021",yall ever just read really fast then get sad when its alr done so you reread the same ep again like 5 times to appreciate all the little details 🧍
32,"Jan 27, 2021",dokja and gilyeong are my favourite father-son duo ever
32,"Jan 27, 2021",but you guys we're forgetting one thing: this scenario lasts for a whole damn week!
32,"Jan 28, 2021",*laughs in novel reader*
32,"Jan 27, 2021","*Junhyeok Yu and Dokja are actually divorced parents of Gilyeong.
Junhyeok : Give me the child.
Dokja : Take the child
😂😂😂😂😂😂"
32,"Jan 27, 2021","RIP to Gilyeong saying ""Dokja-hyung"" 😔😔😔"
32,"Jan 23, 2021",I spent 5 coins just to see if they survive and end up on another cliff hanger. I don't think I'll survive the next 2 weeks.
32,"Dec 27, 2020",Lee gilyoung continues to be the best boy in the world and the 1# Kim dokja Stan 
32,"Dec 10, 2020","Looks like, “Jonghyuk you bastard “ will be my new weekly affirmation mantra "
32,"Jun 18, 2021",Dokja is basically Gilyeongs father at this point
32,"Jan 28, 2021",It was so cool when they both agreed in protecting Gilyeong
32,"Jan 27, 2021","I am glad that they're showing that, however coldly pragmatic Dokja tries and believes himself to be, deep down he is enough of a good person that he wants to protect his group."
32,"Jan 27, 2021",Pleasantly surprised Junghyuk took in Gilyeong. Maybe he does have a heart? Or he just wanted to watch Dokja fight unencumbered ...
32,"Jan 27, 2021","""Gilyeong will not die."" Everyone, this marks the moment that Dokja became a father. *Edit: I just saw the next part where he said ""at least not today"" and I STG THIS BASTARD-"
32,"Jan 31, 2021","honestly, I don't deserve reading this masterpiece for free"
32,"Jan 28, 2021",dokja is gilyeong's father figure 🥰
32,"Jan 28, 2021","I forgot how much I hate Junghyeok in the earlier chapter, hhhhe get better he get better he get better"
32,"Jan 27, 2021",Dokja is really the BEST PROTAGONIST. I wonder if the author of TWSA is proud of him. 
32,"Jan 22, 2021","[The Constellation Free Coins Spender is crying her eyes out] 
because that was a touching moment between dokja and gilyeong and also because i spend my coins for another cliffhanger @.@"
32,"May 1, 2021","Dokja is the lil one’s offical guardian, the moment he said “Dokja” - “Not now I’m busy” -> I’m feeling parent vibes😂😂"
32,"Apr 29, 2021",'Could you move aside' he asks politely 😭😂❤️
32,"Feb 1, 2021",A divorced couple protecting a child....well one of them is🙂
32,"Jan 30, 2021",Dokja really said: IM A FATHER NO DRAMA
32,"Jan 30, 2021",Protect Gilyeong at ALL COSTS
32,"Jan 29, 2021",wait- people hate Dokja? I love his character! huh????
32,"Jan 29, 2021","I mean this comment isn't mine but I thought it would be interesting to mention that this is the first time Dokja has directly answered Jonghyuk's thoughts.  'I told you you would die' ""I'm not gonna die""                     But its really specific enough for Jonghyuk to notice I guess."
32,"Jan 28, 2021","Really tho, Jonghyuk and Dokja’s relationship is just “Bruh your gonna frickin die” “Bruh I’m not gonna frickin die” *Dokja lives* “Bruh how did you not fricken die?” “Bruh I told you, I’m not gonna fricken die.” “Bruhhhhh” And repeat. I love it lol."
32,"Jan 28, 2021",I like how Dokja caring about Gilyoung like a father
32,"Jan 28, 2021",H- he’ll be fine
32,"Jan 28, 2021",he said he aint gonna die HE AINT GONNA DIE
32,"Jan 27, 2021",this is only c rank difficulty. i wonder what s or ss difficulty would be
32,"Jan 27, 2021","Honestly even if Dokja ends up separating from the others at some point, I hope Gilyeong will still stay with him. They have such a good relationship and Gilyeong often seems more like an adult that those around him"
32,"Jan 27, 2021",I absolutely love dokja as a character. he is such an ass but he is so human too. 
32,"Jan 27, 2021",gilyeong and dokja's interactions are so fucking wholesome.
32,"Jan 22, 2021",Too be honest you have to give at least some amount of credit when they both want the kid to be safe😁it’s the small victory’s people
32,"Jun 11, 2021","they both prioritize protecting gilyeong! take the kid/ hand over the kid, very cute of them. parents yes."
32,"Feb 12, 2021",dokja is the big brother we all need
32,"Feb 11, 2021","my favorite character has to be Gilyeong, he's so cute and innocent, and I love how Dokja is like a big brother/father to him, i just need more of Dokja holding Gilyeong and then being like father/big brother and son/younger brother "
32,"Feb 2, 2021",I HAVE NEVER LOVED FOR WEDNESDAY TO COME THIS BADLY
32,"Jan 31, 2021",if they don't hurry up and make this an anime 😭

32,"Jan 30, 2021",Father figure/big brother figure >>>> any kind of romance
32,"Jan 30, 2021","If he was dead, he wouldn't have been on the thumbnail of the next chapter."
32,"Jan 28, 2021",I don’t know what to else to say other than the relationship between the two is so cute like can he adopt the child
32,"Jan 28, 2021",*me see new chap* wow new chapter😳😲.....me later after reading: 😐😶...and now we wait...
32,"Jan 27, 2021",*Episode 31: SERIES FINALE*. 🤣
32,"Jan 27, 2021",one of the main rules to writing a story is that the protagonist shouldn't die. Only near death experiences. So we gucci➖👄➖👌
32,"Jan 27, 2021",At this point I don’t even understand whether jonghyuk wants dokja to survive or not lmao- 
32,"Jan 27, 2021",When you're not even worried a lil bit because you already know he ain't dead 😂 
32,"Jan 27, 2021",I might be reading it oddly but it looked as if they both simultaneously agreed on saving gilyeong 
32,"Jan 27, 2021",Gilyeong is literally my favorite character... the loyalty and they stuff that leaves this child's mouth... I just can't... I was about to have a massive fit if Dokja left our Gil to die

32,"Jan 27, 2021",Junghyeok takes the VIP seat to watch how strong Dokja is
32,"Jan 27, 2021",lol i loved dokja's expression when he told junghyeok to move aside. Junghyeok really is petty for someone who regressed thrice..at least im glad he let the kid stayed with him and stop him from leaving the green zone. maybe he still has a little humanity left inside him

32,"Apr 28, 2021",dude when Jonghyuk took the kid either he actually has some heart or he just wanted his strength. I'm hoping he has some heart. 
32,"Apr 27, 2021",Dokja is a damn sweetheart and he only says he's not a hero/protagonist because he doesn't believe he's worthy of being called one. But he IS one already. Has been. I wonder if a Constellation will gift him something greater than coins?

32,"Jan 28, 2021",Lol I love dokja <3
32,"Jan 28, 2021",not the protagonist he says- THEN EXPLAIN WHY U HAVE THIS?!?! *holds up plot armour*
32,"Jan 28, 2021","""im not drowning "" he said while sinking to the bottom of the ocean never to be seen again"
32,"Jan 28, 2021",I love how Dokja treats Gilyeong 🥺🥺🥺 like he speaks to him as an adult but cares about him and protects him cause he is still a kid
32,"Jan 28, 2021",No way Dokja is gonna die. The story would end if he died. (Logical reasoning to help my worrying ass)
32,"Jan 28, 2021",If he says he won’t die he simply won’t 
32,"Jan 28, 2021",I made the mistake of reading some of the web novel and now I’m a little disappointed by the dialogue in the webtoon. 😕it just didn’t hit the same
32,"Jan 28, 2021","""at least take this kid"" ""give me the child"" idk why but I just found this so funny lmao"
32,"Jan 27, 2021","dokja  your such a dad. also, it would be nice if you didn't almost die like this for almost every single scenario"
32,"Jan 27, 2021",I find it interesting that Dokja is trying to be different from Junghyuk but then both of them think to save Gilyoung. Maybe  they're more similar than Dokja realised and maybe that's ok
32,"Jan 27, 2021","Some of the monsters have green eyes, are they considered green zones or am i tripping"
32,"Jan 27, 2021","""I'm not gonna die."" *the bears behind him* are you sure about that?"

32,"Jan 27, 2021","Damn, let me just say again, this kid is metal "
32,"Jan 27, 2021",This is one of the main reasons why Gilyeoung-ah will never like Yu Junghyeok

32,"Apr 26, 2021","I DON'T THINK JUNGHYEOK TOOK GILYEONG BECAUSE HE WANTS TO PROTECT HIM OR SOMETHING, I STILL BELIEVE HE USED THE EYE OF SAGE ON GILYEONG AND FOUND SOMETHING USEFUL"
32,"Apr 12, 2021","say what u will about junghyeok, but the way he immediately was like give me the kid already bastard was weirdly touching for me"
32,"Mar 15, 2021",jonghyuk... i truly love that asshole😭😭
32,"Feb 18, 2021","He’s so petty but he’s like “I’m petty but this child, I’ll take the child because I can see you care about him” the dude does care for him he is just showing it like Naruto and Sasuke show it. My fellow Weebs should get the reference "
32,"Feb 4, 2021","Don't worry dokja even tho you dont consider yourself as the protagonist, Me and us readers consider you our protagonist. "
32,"Feb 3, 2021",i just love dokja being a proud papa
32,"Feb 3, 2021",gilyeong saying it's okay to leave him behind broke my heart 
32,"Feb 3, 2021",Damn I love Gilyeong
32,"Feb 2, 2021","hello translator-nim, thanks for your hard work and i would happy if you put honorific for the character like gilyeong to call dokja with 'hyung' 😊"

32,"Jan 31, 2021",Gilyeong is officially the cutest and the most amazing character in this whole webtoon you don't need to agree with me he just is and dokja is just amazing i love the fact that he cares for him so much T^T so freaking cute
32,"Jan 30, 2021","""I'm not gonna die""
STFU KIM DOKJA YOU ASSHOLE"
32,"Jan 29, 2021",I hope this gets an adaptation TV show or something like that.

32,"Jan 29, 2021",Die? Pfft he survived a freaking oversized snake with teeth’s stomach
32,"Jan 28, 2021",I have a quick theory so I saw a comment that asked that if to Yu if the people around him were like NPC’s and that gave me an idea which basically is when Yu regresses the people are always different which means that each time he regresses he goes to a new planet similar to each so each time he dies/regresses he moves to a new place idk how to explain it
32,"Jan 28, 2021",I love how realistic the kid is but even though dookja knows it’s for the best he does the right thing anyway 
32,"Jan 28, 2021",constelation sad ol broke weeb ned coins :<
32,"Jan 28, 2021","Dokja:""I'm not gonna die"" *not a protagonist* Dokja:Well, sh*t."

32,"Jan 28, 2021",I'm litterally not even worried at this point-
32,"Jan 28, 2021",If Dokja doesn’t end up with the kid calling him his brother by accident I’m going to be a bit disappointed.
32,"Jan 28, 2021",I think Junghyeok wants Gilhyeong for something. Remember when he was staring at the group and gasped about something.i think that's the reason he was fast to accept the boy.
32,"Jan 28, 2021","A wise protagonist once said, “People die when they are killed”"

32,"Jan 27, 2021","When people are saying the penalty isn't dying so he isn't going to die. Literally makes no sense. You have to survive the monsters of course there is a chance of surviving but if you get eaten by a monster, you die.Edit: Maybe they spawn again? But then why do they say to survive the monsters. So like maybe I am wrong but it just doesn't make sense if ??? Let's the people respawn unless there was some type of disadvantage because of it. "
32,"Jan 27, 2021",When the final room said 1/2 I was like NOO 🤧😱
32,"Jan 27, 2021",i think dokja just tell himself he'll do anything to survive and blah blah mostly because he doesn’t wanna think he's too emotional or a fool but he actually cares and he just doesn’t accept it...i mean he's always choosing ways where he doesn’t have to kill and he cares about his teammates
32,"Jan 27, 2021","I, too, wish to sock yoo jonghyuk across the face"

32,"Nov 7, 2021",So...As much as I would like to believe that Junghyeok let Gil in because he's being a nice person...I know better 😂 He definitely peeped Gil's stats earlier and must have seen an attribute or something that tipped him off about Gil's potential as an ally. That's why he purposefully occupied this spot - to get Gil into his fold. Just my theory but I bet I'm right LOL

32,"Feb 18, 2021",I just realised that the possible reason for the characters not being up to Jongheok’s expectations is because Dokja is hellbent on protecting the characters which puts then at less risk. That or Jongheok trains his underlings in a brutal way.

32,"Jan 28, 2021",YOOOO dokja saying hes not gonna die holding up his sword to defend against the monsters while being surrounded has to be one of the most epic scenes ive read in webtoons
32,"Jan 28, 2021",gilyeong is very perceptive. hes able to realize why dokja does the things he does which is why he was the only one open towards the killing option and also he was able to know that dokja wouldve done better without them. i think he matured too fast😢

32,"Jan 27, 2021",Great chapter! As usual Dokja and Jonghyeok's interactions are so interesting and satisfying. Dokja's development in this chapter is pretty interesting... This is good stuff!
32,"Jan 27, 2021",yu joonghyuk is more of an antagonist than a protagonist in my eyes
32,"Jan 27, 2021","I believe Yoo Jonghyuk was willing to save Gilyoung because he wanted him on his team... I mean, the kid has potential and is brave af. With Donna gone, maybe he thinks he will be able to recruit him? Idk, I just don't think he did it without a reason 😂"

32,"Feb 28, 2022",The bind between Gilyeong and Dokja is that of brothers or father and son. I hope Dokja gets a good punch in Junghyeok's jaw 👹. Thanks for the riveting episode authors 💫
32,"Feb 27, 2022",kinda surprised that junghyeok wanted to save the child

32,"Mar 4, 2021",I'm officially in love with dokja. Also pretty sure the reason why junghyeok took gilyeong was because he took interest in him.

32,"Jan 28, 2021","Of course, there are more than one episode in each chapter, so this is going to take at least 50 years. I guess I'll be reading this for a while."

32,"Jan 27, 2021",Dokja has the secret weapons of all armor!! plot armor 👍😁
32,"Jan 27, 2021",How do these webtoons get so many like even tho they are just cliff hangers

32,"Jan 27, 2021",He can be the best father for sure
32,"Jan 27, 2021",at least dokja isn't heartless. he knows for a fact he might be better off with no allies with morals slowing him down but he keeps them not as extra sacrifices. if he did the kid would have been killed just now
32,"Jan 27, 2021",Gilyeong must not die 
32,"Jan 27, 2021",Guys if he was gonna die the penalty would say death instead of ?
32,"Jan 27, 2021","The way Junghyeok and Dokja treats each other makes me wanna start building their ship😶😒

32,"Jan 27, 2021",Isn't it a bit shorter than usual? I feel like they had to sacrifice few pages just to use this cliffhanger.
32,"Jan 27, 2021","wait y'all it looks like dokja disappeared! you can see that his hand is still there, and the position his hand is in wouldn't make sense if he got eaten"
32,"Jan 27, 2021",I think Junghyeok is testing Dokja to see if he is friend or foe its only times of desperation when we see peoples true colors especially for some one like Dokja who is very secretive. Also I don't blame Junghyeok a mysterious stranger suddenly appears in your third run of the game and wants to be your friend you would think the system is trying to trick and maniupulate you. So yeah
32,"Jan 27, 2021","It's so interesting to see this kind of YJY again lmaoooo. He's so petty, this sunfish bastard."

From lvls 1-10 (400 per lvl) 11-20 (500 per lvl). So if my prediction is correct, he's gonna do a lil something called a 'pro-reader' move and not waste coins. Instead he'll unlock a new ability.

32,"Jan 28, 2021",WAIT HE REALLY DID DIE BUT USED A BOOKMARK!!! this is awesome!!!!!!!
32,"Jan 28, 2021",I feel like the reason he took the child is because he is a child. Idk but the theories are a bit too big imo. Sure he is an ass often but maybe he thought the kid doesn’t deserve to die this young. Or maybe im too simple minded
32,"Jan 27, 2021","he's not gonna die : if he was it would mean the penalty for failure is death, but since it isn't said, it means the penalty is not death... ... I hope I'm right."
32,"Jan 27, 2021",Gilyeong and Dokjas relationship I kinda wholesome even tho Donna has ulterior motives
32,"Jan 27, 2021",I really dont trust jonghyuk because he told dokja to give him gilyeong

32,"Dec 9, 2020",The constaltion of Readers is threatening Dokkaebi author (there name is to long) to stop the fucking cliffhangers
32,"Dec 9, 2020",i refuse
32,"Jan 27, 2021",Dokja plot armor is crap I swear too y'all
32,"Dec 9, 2020",Does anyone else see a pattern here? Everytime Dokja appears to die he really just eaten before digestion and then uses a item he's gained before to get out alive.
32,"Dec 9, 2020",I wish my coins allowed me to buy episodes from the future. I'd sell a kidney for the money I swear.

32,"Dec 9, 2020",Jonghyeok Yu is a total d*ck... i can't help but feel attracted to him 🙃 what gilyeong has been through has made him too mature for his age it's scary
32,"Nov 27, 2021",ok don't blame me but I kinda - just a little - ship Dokja and Junghyeok and then them being father figures for Gilyeong.is that just me or-

32,"Jan 27, 2021",Why is this app charging us for episodes and acting like they have some right to it when they are like 10 episodes behind the actual manga...
32,"Jan 27, 2021","I just read this on mixed manga, I'm not fast passing. They aren't even the original creators, they just have translated, there's other websites that have better english translation."

32,"Dec 9, 2020",*sigh* I'm already spending money on new chapters. No need for all the cliffhangers. It might actually do more harm than good in the end.
32,"Jan 27, 2021","I know what happens next guys :)
