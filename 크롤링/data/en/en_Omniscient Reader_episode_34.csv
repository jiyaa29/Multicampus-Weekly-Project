Episode,Date,Review
34,"Dec 23, 2020","Dokja saying that this time it will be more dangerous than when he sent them running straight towards the herd of enemies doesn't sound very encouraging, huh."
34,"Dec 23, 2020","Well, damn, Dokja seemed to be a bit more manipulative this episode.  He even brought up that one scene from the first few chapters, causing Jihye to relive some of her trauma.  But its cool to see a character that isnt trying to live up to an ideal, kind of gives me somebody to relate to more."
34,"Dec 23, 2020",Dokja got to sleep on the thigh of a character from his favorite novel 👌 
34,"Dec 23, 2020",i love how complimenting the muscles just brings him closer to awakening haha
34,"Dec 23, 2020","""Your muscles are awesome."" Can confirm, works every time"
34,"Dec 26, 2020",people are calling dokja manipulative and a few chapters ago they were calling him sociopathic but bruh. Everything he's doing is for his teams survival not his own. He even gave the girl that cloak and he's trying to bring their potential out so they get stronger as a team. He's just someone that's doing whatever it takes for him and the people he cares about to survive. 
34,"Feb 10, 2021","Dokja's facial expressions are 30% looking done with everything, 30% being angry/annoyed (mainly at Junghyeok), 20% acting like a shameless asshole, and the remaining 20% just sitting there looking pretty. And I 100% love him"
34,"Dec 23, 2020",Wow Dojka your new record. Manipulating 2 people in 1 chapter
34,"Dec 23, 2020","Btw, has anyone noticed that these dudes have been tolerating the smell of blood and rotting flesh for a while now? "
34,"Dec 23, 2020","I love how the other three were looking like, 'What is this rat bastard up to now, is it scam time on a team mate??', while KDJ was complimenting LHS. Even Sangah was looking weirded out and she's the nicest of them all lmao. "
34,"Dec 24, 2020","Dokja, please gift me your copy of TWSA for Christmas so when the new year comes, I'll be prepared. "
34,"Dec 24, 2020",I love the thigh pillow train they started 🤣💛
34,"Dec 23, 2020","I love how simple he is, ""Nice muscles"" (introspective begins) yeah they are nice, man thats probably enough to evolve into stage 2 dont you think constellations? I mean look at these juicy pecs. "
34,"Dec 23, 2020","Dokja: If there's no more rooms, then we'll... *Puts  on sunglasses*...make room. YEAAAAAAAA"
34,"Dec 23, 2020",Hyeonseong reminds me of a puppy ♡
34,"Dec 23, 2020",This webtoon is so good. Too far down the coin rabbit hole now folks
34,"Dec 23, 2020",{The constellation Webtoon Reader is upset that theres no more fast pass}
34,"Feb 10, 2021","Makes me wonder, if Gilyeong has lice, will he talk to them too?"
34,"Dec 23, 2020","Ahhh... man, I ended up seeking out the actual novel because of this lol. Take my coins you glorious madmen, take my sponsored coins. "
34,"Feb 10, 2021",Most WEBTOONs: I SHIP EM . THIS WEBTOON: I wonder how many people in totally they all will kill together
34,"Feb 10, 2021","I love Dokja's character. He's not your typical justice-over-all self sacrificing hero. He's really smart and calculated but isn't automatically classified as a nerd. He stands up for himself and won't take other people's crap, but isn't a complete jerk. It's refreshing and quite nice to find a character that doesn't just fall in line with every other protagonist. "
34,"Dec 23, 2020",Ooo potential new ally approaching? It's interesting to see how the outcomes change based on just the effect of our main character's existence too.
34,"Dec 23, 2020",I wanna know what he plans to use all his coins for... he specifically mentioned he saved enough... what is iiiiit
34,"Dec 23, 2020",That poor landlord doesn't even know he's about to be unacquainted with his teeth. I'm excited for this fight to happen!
34,"Dec 23, 2020",The Secretive Plotter constellation will gift this man 5000 coins if he keeps this up. He's a little too good at manipulation. 
34,"Jan 1, 2021",Your muscles are awesome! That’s all we ever want to hear
34,"Dec 23, 2020",This is a pay to read content now. I'm not disappointed 
34,"Dec 28, 2020",I love how there is technically two protagonists. I think might end up fighting. That would sooo cooll
34,"Dec 23, 2020","""Tonight could be even more dangerous than last night"" shit is about to go down."
34,"Dec 23, 2020",God I love this series
34,"Feb 10, 2021",Gilyeong napping on Dokja napping on Hyeonseong napping was adorable
34,"Feb 10, 2021","is it just me who misses the non-anglicized names and the honorifics? I miss seeing the ""-ssi"", ""hyung"", and their last names in front of their first names idk "
34,"Feb 10, 2021",Hyeonseong: My favourite song was green pine tree 😊   Huiwon: DiD I aSk?
34,"Feb 10, 2021",Every time I see Gilyeong my hurt just melts. He's too precious. Must protecc 🥺
34,"Feb 10, 2021","I keep seeing comments that Dokja is too OP but if you pay attention hes not, he's playing things smart, he plans ahead. He knows what he's doing. But that does not mean he's OP. Hes a awesome guy tho!"
34,"Feb 5, 2021","i dont know why so many people try to scold dojka on his recent actions because lol he's not here to live up to the classic mc role of being good and blah blah blah, he's a real(?) dude with, what seems, a very fucked up childhood that read a novel that became reality. at the end of the day he's going to do whatever is best to achieve the final of the novel in the real world"
34,"Feb 11, 2021",its like a dating sim game but we're just tryna cheer up one guy 
34,"Feb 10, 2021","Him being the protagonist of this story makes it more interesting considering the fact that he isn't good. I mean he isn't like those guys who always finds a way without resorting to violence or without breaking any law. Hes the type of person who many of us could relate to cuz he gets greedy, he pities, he sacrifices, he gets cold hearted and mean, he gets soft, he depend on other people, he helps, he destroy, he cares, and he survives "
34,"Feb 10, 2021","Wow I didn’t expect gilyeong to have his bug friends in his hair, also his “nice muscles” compliment 😂"
34,"Feb 10, 2021",“What the h*ll do you know?!” What Dokja thinks: “Literally everything about this world.” What he says: “Nothing of course.”
34,"Feb 10, 2021",okay but I think the relationship between Dokja and Hyeonseong is very cute and I love seeing everytime they interact with eachother 😌
34,"Feb 10, 2021","The comments are all about how Dokja is manipulative, but he's not trying to harm anyone by doing that. In fact, they benifit from it as they grow stronger & increase their chances of living. And most importantly remember that Yoo Joonghyuk the regressor would be ""manipulating"" them& recruiting them into his party had it not been for Dokja & he does this literally every one of his regressions"
34,"Apr 8, 2021","dammit I'm way too easily swayed by humble precious himbos like Hyeonseong. just one look at their faces that scream ""I... did something good? I'm useful? I will follow you to the ends of the earth."" and I'm already tearing up "
34,"Feb 10, 2021",Hyeonseong is such a precious puppy man and I love him
34,"Feb 10, 2021","As much as Dokja was pretty manipulative and this was quite a really tense episode, my head is just full of thoughts about Gilyeong sleeping on Dokja's thigh while Dokja is sleeping on Hyeonseong's thighs."
34,"Feb 10, 2021",she compliment him by comparing him to a pine tree😂
34,"Dec 23, 2020",{webtoon reader is waiting for their attribute *faster fast pass* to blossom}
34,"Dec 23, 2020",please just take my coins i dont need them
34,"Feb 15, 2021","Does anyone else think Dokja is like really hot?? No, just me? K."
34,"Feb 11, 2021",“Your muscles are awesome” *everyone likes that*
34,"Dec 25, 2020",I kinda feel bad for Jihye... she does seem like she was kind of like Gilyeoung before all hell broke lose but she didn’t have someone like Dokja to guide her 😔
34,"May 1, 2021","“Secretive Plotter wants to know about your mother” : So bro, your mother single orr?"
34,"Feb 10, 2021",I love how Gilyeong lets the bugs come onto his head. They’re just chilling in his hair. His skill is so cool. 
34,"Apr 7, 2021",Uwahhhh gilyeoung (dunno if i spelled that right) is sooo cute and him and dokja’s relationship is so wholesome 😖🥰🥺😭 
34,"Feb 11, 2021",Plot twist: we ARE the constellations
34,"Feb 11, 2021","I love how Hyenseong has become the team's Pokémon, they want to evolve him and everything"
34,"Feb 10, 2021","I really love Dokja as a character, many readers call dokja a manipulative person but that's not necessarily a bad attribute, considering he is doing it for the best of all of them, like I understand not many of you will call him a selfless person doing it for the greater good. At least not yet... "
34,"Mar 5, 2021","dokja is such  a well written character honestly, i love him sm, and  them trying to cheer up jonghyuk this ep was hilaroius and adorable xD huisong being like ""i didnt ask"" ahaha oh huisong,,,hyeongseong is so wholesome, poor guy looked like a sad puppy after huisong but im glad the others cheered him up"
34,"Feb 15, 2021","as far I know for celebrate dokja birthday, the fans in korea make and large ads in station at seoul and busan. even munpia, the novel publisher also celebrate dokja birthday by produce and design chocholate box with a lot of omniscient reader ornament inside it with singshong sign and price that I can't pay 😂 and its sold out only few days. now I saw that fans in korea made cafe that design just for dokja birthday. a lot of people really love dokja right 😊😊"
34,"Feb 11, 2021",I’m curious to see when our other girl is going to come out to complete our badass trinity 
34,"Feb 10, 2021","Ah Dokja is so cool and interesting. The way the story has built his character really draws you in whenever he does something. Also, I love Hyeonseong a lot. I'm really excited for his 'moment'."
34,"Feb 10, 2021",not them acting like gilyeongs parents aww
34,"Apr 29, 2021","Hyeonseong, you did very... WHALE 🐋 🤣😂 "
34,"Mar 21, 2021","I love how Huiwon never trust anything Dokja is saying. Haha, she always looks like 'are u kidding me?' but in the end she'll follow along "
34,"Feb 11, 2021",she's really pretty and capable! love the bunny charm on a harmful sword LOL
34,"Feb 10, 2021","You know what's so cute, it's that Gilyeong was thinking of Dokja even in his SLEEP"
34,"Dec 23, 2020",i cant wait for the next episode author your doing great 👍
34,"Feb 10, 2021",Must. Protecc. Gilyeong.
34,"Mar 29, 2021",Is it me or these four constellations are like his biggest fans?
34,"Mar 12, 2021","Bro I am blown away every time I read another chapter of this. The art style and work is beautiful and the story. Oh my lord it’s perfect, the idea of a reader knowing all but not completely abusing it. Along with that he’s realizing that the story is changing from what he knew. "
34,"Feb 12, 2021",Im just imagining that when Dokja is patting/ruffling Gilyeong's hair and then he just feels the cockroaches in Gilyeong's hair
34,"Feb 11, 2021",The guys all laying on each other was sweet. Nice they want to cheer him up. I’m curious about his trauma but it definitely looks sad. 
34,"Feb 10, 2021","#DokjaistheBestProtagonist because he is a manipulative, lying, two faced bastard. Because he is more REAL than IDEAL which is what I love about him. And the gang cheering on Hyeonseong is sooooo cute!!!!!"
34,"Feb 10, 2021",Thick thighs save lives. 
34,"Feb 10, 2021",Dokja using Hyeonseong’s thighs as a pillow 🤣
34,"Feb 27, 2021",Hyunseung is so cute with polishing his shield hahaha
34,"Feb 16, 2021",HAPPY BIRTHDAY KIM DOKJA JUST REMEMBERED TAHT ITS YOUR BIRTHDAY TODAY AFTER I JOINED THE ORV REDDIT! 
34,"Feb 15, 2021","HAPPY BIRTHDAY DOKJA!! YOU ARE SUCH AN IMPORTANT PERSON AND I LOVE YOU SO MUCH EVEN IF YOU ARE AN INFURIATING ASSHOLE BUT YOU ARE WORTH IT AND I APPRECIATE YOU OK? I DON'T CARE IF IT'S WEIRD THAT I'M SPEAKING TO A FICTIONAL CHARACTER, I MIGHT AS WELL WISH THIS BASTARD A GOOD BIRTHDAY "
34,"Feb 14, 2021","tomorrow is Kim Dokja's birthday♥ happy birthday Dokja!!! i saw the korean fans put up a poster(?) or billboard(?) in the subway showing Dokja reading while surrounded with books with a caption ""happy birthday Kim Dokja""🎂🎉🎊"
34,"Feb 12, 2021","""My favorite song from the military was green pine tree!"" Huiwon: *looking disturbed* ""I never asked you that..."" That part killed me"
34,"Feb 10, 2021","Lhs is so sweet and so was all of them trying to cheer him up. As for Lee Jihye, I'm waiting for her chance to shine"
34,"Feb 15, 2021",reading this hit different when you already read the web novel hyunsung may be military but he's the softest
34,"Feb 15, 2021","Now 15 feb in korea, HAPPY BIRTHDAY OUR BELOVED RAT BASTARD, KIM DOKJA 🎉🎉🎉🎉  THE ONLY MANIPULATIVE GUY THAT I LOVE. and I am imagining with how much dokja special birthday fanart that I will get today 😂 "
34,"Feb 11, 2021",idc what anyone else says. there is a good bromance and I am HERE for it
34,"Feb 10, 2021",Can we just appreciate the panel of Gilyeong curled up asleep on Dokja for a minute??? SO CUTE!!!!!!!!!!!!! ♥️😍♥️👏
34,"Feb 10, 2021",Damn these top comments are from December how much coins did y’all spend
34,"Feb 10, 2021","dokja : this is will be dangerous, me : man just tell me when you are not plan anything that let you in the dangerous situation from the beginning? 😂"
34,"Jun 11, 2021","I love how real and imperfect Dokja is. I'm tired of seeing righteous, hero characters. His manipulation and ability to do whatever it takes to survive and thrive is so refreshing. You can tell he's still a good person, but he doesn't let that hinder him. It makes me able to relate to him. He's perfectly ""flawed."""
34,"May 8, 2021",Gilyeong sleeping on Dokja 😭😭😭 aaand here we go again!
34,"Apr 29, 2021",Gosh first the kid and now the tank...why are they all so adorableeeee 😭 
34,"Apr 12, 2021",hyeonseong is so cute 😭❤️
34,"Feb 15, 2021","omg i like it that many people love Dokja. I just saw somewhere that ""somebody registered a star in Dokja's name for his bday"". Can anyone confirm? what does it mean? Does that mean there is an actual star named Kim Dokja now? if there is then OMG whoever did that i love you!!"
34,"Feb 15, 2021",HAPPY HAPPU BIRTHDAY KIM DOKJA!! THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR EXISTING🥺🥺 YOU MATTER SO MUCH!! YOU MEAN SO MUCH TO ALL OF US!!💞😭💗😭 I LOVE YOU AND I CHERISH YOU YOURE LITERALLY MY FIRST COMFORT CHARACTER AND IM VERY PROUD OF THAT💝💗 YOU ARE MY WORLD YOU ARE MY STAR🥺🥺🥺 WE LOVE YOU YOU STUPID SQUID !!😭😭
34,"Feb 11, 2021","I forgot what his mom did and I was VERY taken aback by ""The Constellation, Secretive Plotter, wants to know about your mother"""
34,"Feb 10, 2021",Hey so does anyone else see Lazy Broke Weeb in this Webtoon’s comments all the time or is it just me?
34,"Feb 10, 2021",i just had a sudden realization that dokja's birthday is in 5 days im—
34,"Feb 10, 2021",hyunsung is such pure right 😂 and the way they try to encourage hyunsung is cute XD
34,"May 2, 2021",Why is nobody discussing how Gil was probably even dreaming about Dokja...kid loves him.
34,"Mar 31, 2021",Dokja making me feel like I'm the omniscient reader
34,"Feb 16, 2021",You guys are really slacking with liking the chapters 😐
34,"Feb 15, 2021",happy birthday Kim Dokja 🎉🎊
34,"Feb 14, 2021","me: ""lol im not biased, i dont only care abt dokja"" also me: *doesnt know that apparently toDAY IS JIHYE'S BDAY and only prepares for dokja's (which is tmrw)*"
34,"Feb 11, 2021","i know it's to his survival advantage to see them as just characters, and the world he's living as just the TWSA story...but i hope he starts to see them more as the real people they are soon"
34,"Feb 11, 2021",Im curious of gilyoungs thoughts first he kept on looking at dokja and observing and he even sleep talked his name... and im so CURIOUS to know what gilyoung talked to Junghyeok about
34,"Feb 10, 2021",Gilyeong dreaming of Dokja is the most wholesome thing ever
34,"Feb 10, 2021","If you want to support the author, read the official translation of the novel this is based on at Webnovel under the same title"
34,"Dec 25, 2020","hehe, coins go brr"
34,"Dec 23, 2020","I'm here, i'm awake, i didn't missed it ! Let's go back to sleep now..."
34,"Apr 30, 2021",IM SO SORRY BUT DOES THAT KID HAVE ROACHES IN HIS HAIR?
34,"Apr 29, 2021",anyone else notice the gradual decline in likes and comments...?
34,"Apr 29, 2021",How Gilyeong just sleeps on Dokja's lap 🤧💖 
34,"Apr 28, 2021","I love Dokja’s character. He’s not trying to be a perfectly good, super brave, super smart hero that saves everyone; he’s literally just the dude who ended up living through the storyline of a book. It’s okay that he may be a little hypocritical, it’s okay that he’s a little manipulative at times, it’s okay that he’s not trying to save everyone; he’s a normal human that I can relate to and respect, and that’s what I love about him."
34,"Apr 16, 2021",I NEED AN ANIME
34,"Mar 13, 2021",Hyeongseong's thigh is a national treasure! Must protect!
34,"Feb 25, 2021",awwwe gilyeong muttering dokja in his sleep 😻😻😻
34,"Feb 17, 2021",Gildyeong sleeping on Dokja’s thigh makes me so happy 😭😭 — he finds him safe and comfortable to be around — holy heck I might just cry

34,"Feb 15, 2021","I am so mad at webtoon, why have events for 3 coins when we obviously need minimum 5? Like must I suffer and wait to read because I’m broke? "
34,"Feb 15, 2021",HAPPY DOKJA DAY LETS GOOOOOO
34,"Feb 15, 2021",this when hyunsung fell for kim dokja
34,"Feb 12, 2021",I love re-reading this as a web comic. I love seeing all their facial expressions with eachother.
34,"Feb 11, 2021",the ways they tried to improve hyeonsong's self esteem were cute🤣 and i know gungye from ji sukjin's running man😂
34,"Feb 11, 2021",Kim Dokja isn’t worried for his group he’s worried for the landlords because he knows that Jung Heewon will shank their asses and I respect that 💀💀
34,"Feb 11, 2021",I don't know about you but my fav part of this episode was when Gilyeong was laying on Dokjas thigh sooooo cute lol
34,"Feb 11, 2021",Hyeongsong is a man. A grown ass man. But he's so cute. 😭 
34,"Feb 11, 2021","""What are the plans for tonight? We could do what we did yesterday..."" Dokja: ""No that was a one-time thing"" Me: You need to Work on your phrasing"
34,"Feb 10, 2021",Gilyeon pulled something simple but effective... everyone: wut?
34,"Feb 10, 2021",Heewon being a sassy queen😎😎: diD i aSk??
34,"Feb 10, 2021","Why is no one talking about ""I never asked that"" Huiwon is hilarious 😂"
34,"Feb 10, 2021","translation team, we've been asking for this for DAYSSS please add the honorifics!! you guys are doing great and I really really appreciate y'all but please just add the honorifics 🥲 it adds more to the story and the characters relationships with each other,, you guys fixed the regressor thing please add honorifics too"
34,"Feb 10, 2021","The webtoon is awesome, bringing all characters to life, but guys I HEAVILY recommend the novel. Read it from the start. You’ll see the difference. Dokja’s burns are also at a whole different level."
34,"Feb 10, 2021",Okay so... Dokja was asleep on Hyeonseong’s thigh... all while Gilyeong was asleep on Dokja’s thigh.... who then called out Dokja’s name while half asleep. I know they’re like constantly in a state of life or death BUT THATS SO FREAKING CUTE OMG
34,"Feb 10, 2021",Love how Hyeonseong went from sad to happy lol 😂 
34,"Feb 10, 2021",Ooh we gonna see Jihye's backstory soon 👀
34,"Oct 21, 2021",mc casually guilt tripping a teenager lmao
34,"May 22, 2021",It's cute how Gilyeong was sleeping on Dokja's thigh n Dokja on Hyeonseong's.

34,"May 7, 2021",Ok why is Gil(Gilyeong Lee) so aborable 
34,"Apr 30, 2021",I'm way too invested in the main five. I'm going to be so sad if one of them dies. I'm glad I'm here to binge read a bit. 
34,"Mar 11, 2021",I just realized this whole thing is READER vs GAMER and it cracked me up
34,"Feb 23, 2021",For someone so determined to stay alive he sure does risk his life a lot for the rest of the group.
34,"Feb 18, 2021",most op phone ive ever seen to still have 73% after almost a week
34,"Feb 15, 2021","HAPY BIRTHDAY JIHYE! (I'M ONE DAY LATE SORRY 😭😭) You are such a funny girl, I love your jokes and your attitude! I hope you had a great day! Don't die!"

34,"Feb 14, 2021",I just completed reading the web novel... Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint.......and I just don't know what to write or say....I am just crying like an idiot....that novel is the best.....😭😭😭You won't regret reading it or reading this webtoon.....Ahhh I don't know what will I do....😭😭 The emotions I am feeling right now are unexplainable...Edit- I even changed my name on this ID....from ssanaz to Demon 👑 of Salvation. And this is even his birthday only 1 day is left......uwahhhhh
34,"Feb 13, 2021",It’s Dokja’s birthday the 15th...
34,"Feb 13, 2021",O my god PLEASE this is so good it needs to be animated!! istgg i just can't wait for the next episode but I'm just broke-
34,"Feb 12, 2021",Why it is having less likes? EXCUSE ME ?! THIS WEBTOON IS A HIGH TIER SO 
34,"Feb 12, 2021",I love how Jihye changes from the typical schoolgirl outfit to something more practical like pants. Great cast of characters that empower females instead of objectifying them.
34,"Feb 12, 2021",Dokja isn't perfect and that makes him more exciting. He does care for others but he know he should be his own priority to survive!!
34,"Feb 11, 2021",please make this an anime please please please!
34,"Feb 11, 2021",THE BROMANCE
34,"Feb 11, 2021",Dokja really is an awesome protag
34,"Feb 11, 2021","I am always so excited to read these chapters. The mystery of the plot and the characters are so interesting. Thank you for creating this webtoon, creator. It gives me something to look forward to each week."
34,"Feb 11, 2021","It's nice to see Dokja trying to help Jihye heal from her trauma. PTSD is no joke, especially to a high schooler. Why do you think he's so protective of Gil. "
34,"Feb 10, 2021",Damn I didn't expect for him to wake one military dude's lap nice comedic relief 👌
34,"Feb 10, 2021",Best boi gilyeong with his cute little cockroach friends in his hair 🥰💕
34,"Feb 10, 2021",i’ve said it before and i’m going to say it again i’m so glad that Dokja isn’t your typical protagonist the one which is like no i love people i would never harm them he understands what he need to do to survive and he does it it just gives the webtoon an overall realistic feel
34,"Dec 26, 2020","I spent all of my money for this, and it was definently worth it "
34,"Dec 23, 2020","I think Dokja's biggest weakness is his half hearted belief that his protective instincts are a negative survival trait. But the only reason we're around as a species is due to our ability to work together. The fable of the one true hero is mostly that and even in those stories there are almost always others who sacrifice themselves to get the ""Chosen One"" where they need to be.Or if if you want the sayin;
""Know one is an island.""

34,"Feb 12, 2021",They be treating Hyeonseong like a Sim lmaooo
34,"Feb 12, 2021","""Ar' 'ye ready, kids?"""
34,"Feb 11, 2021",All Hyeongsong needed was Gilyeong to say his muscles are cool!!!! 🤣 oh my word that’s rich! Sangah’s compliments were too deep and that other lady is too strait forward for poor Hyeonseong. He’s still adorable. 
34,"Feb 11, 2021","I wonder if Dokja wrote this story?.... This webtoon is probably like, “Skeleton Soldier Couldn’t Protect The Dungeon”. Where the skeleton was the writer, but he forgot himself cuz he died.But on this book when the regressor dies. Time goes back to the beginning where only the regressor remembers everything. So, Dokja probably wrote the story but forgot everything because of the regressor rewinding time."
34,"Feb 11, 2021",dang Dokja is the ultimate protagonists
34,"Feb 11, 2021","Hyeongseong is so sweet, I can’t wait to see what his attribute will be"
34,"Feb 10, 2021",Aaaww... Gilyeong muttering Dokja's name asleep is so cute uwu... Unless it was a nightmare.
34,"Feb 10, 2021",Reading this episode after reading nearly 400 chapters of the web novel gives me such moe vibes
34,"Feb 10, 2021","Gilyeong becomes funnier and funnier every episode. Also, Dokja becomes smarter and Hyeongseong becomes more timid 😂 "
34,"Feb 10, 2021",Lmao Huiwon said something cute to Hyeonseong but then just killed his moment.
34,"Feb 10, 2021","All the casts of OR are impressive and interesting. Hui won, LHS, Gilyeong, Sangha, Jihye, and those two idiots KDJ and YJH. No doubt, why this comic is my favorite!!"
34,"Feb 10, 2021",Gilyoung pls don’t get lice
34,"Feb 10, 2021","Lol, Dokja was sleeping on Hyeonseong thighs while Gilyeong was in turn sleeping on Dokja's thighs. Also, what's up with Secretive Plotter wanting to know more about Dokja's mum?"

34,"Dec 23, 2020","the constellations are stealing my thoughts, I swear. I really want to know more about Dokja's past. American military is all volunteer, so we wanted to be there (at least to some degree, lying recruiters or not lol) so the concept of not having the choice is an interesting perspective that I hope is explored some more. "
34,"Aug 8, 2021","i've been wondering, how does homeboy Dokja keep his phone charged all the time? I mean, did we ever see him loose battery or charge his phone? Just curious-"

34,"Feb 10, 2021","I see some people saying that dokja is not manipulative and doing whatever it takes for survival. While I disagree, you can’t lie that him bringing about trauma even if it’s for good intentions it has some tones of it . Yes he is doing whatever it takes and it maybe be for a good cause (in his eyes at least since the story doesn’t really follow the black and white evil and good which is great!), still doesn’t mean he is not manipulative. If I murder PART 1"
34,"Feb 10, 2021",ehh I remember these scenes having a lot of depth in the LN but they both felt really boring here

34,"Oct 23, 2021",just a tiny peek of her eyes and you can already sense she's gonna help them
34,"Sep 23, 2021","I kinda forgot about the TWSA characters being in this because it’s hardly mentioned, which is actually rather nice."
34,"Sep 11, 2021","If you think about it, their are and will be characters that are stronger than Dokja. However, he doesn’t have a constellation like these stronger individuals, meaning he has a very good excuse as to why he’s at a disadvantage. And to think he will most likely end up being one of the strongest characters in the series (even though he signed that contract, preventing him from using a constellation) it seems pretty incredible. LOVE THIS SERIES."
34,"Aug 27, 2021",Whale done? Like whaling in a video game but with compliments to boost self esteem. Huiwon is such a mood 😂... I never asked you that 💀 I knew Gilyeong's compliment would be the best. Your muscles are awesome. He's so low maintenance. is that all I needed to do 🤔?

34,"May 29, 2021",You know what I find sad? He tries his best to cheer up Hyunsung when he'd just confront his innermost trauma. I'm pretty sure he didn't get any theraphy either growing up
