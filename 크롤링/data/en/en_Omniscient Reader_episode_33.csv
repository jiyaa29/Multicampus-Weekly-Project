Episode,Date,Review
33,"Dec 16, 2020",So that Gilyeong kid has so much potential that Jonghyuk thinks Dokja is lucky to have him? Interesting lol. Also the fact that he got rejected by the kid in the face xD. Good job kid.
33,"Dec 16, 2020",I can't believe Gilyeong is wanted by Jungeok Yu which means he's insanely powerful as well as THE FACT THAT GILYEONG REJECTED THAT MAN AND WENT STRAIGHT TO DOJKA IS ADORABLE!!!!!!
33,"Dec 16, 2020",so did Dokja's mother kill his father or something and he ended up seeing? also I remember him thinking 'is mother alright? she is mother after all' so she must have no problem killing. Good in this situation (he said in the sea monster) Edit: 🚨I DO NOT RECOMMEND LOOKING IN THE REPLIES PEOPLE PUT SPOILERS🚨 
33,"Dec 16, 2020",it makes sense the kid is sought after. you all acting like he didn't connect with an insect that was the size of a building above ground from the subway 
33,"Dec 16, 2020",Dokja the reader vs anna Croft the prophet vs junghyeok the gamer???? I'm hyped for the future ❤
33,"Dec 16, 2020","Dokja feels like the misterious character in many stories that make random appearances, and we later find out that he has some crazy back story that's hard for the main characters to believe, but it's only revealed towards the end of the story."
33,"Dec 16, 2020","I'm not the only one who noticed Anna Croft lvl up her ""Mental Barrier"" by while talking to Dokja, right? "
33,"Dec 16, 2020",Ah… eng release doesnt give us the sweetness of gilyeong crying out “hyung” when he sees dokja awake. We get the first glimpse into dokjas past… very important. 
33,"Dec 16, 2020","Yjh: Okay, Gilyeong. Choose, Mommy or Daddy? Gilyeong *no hesitation whatsoever*: Mommy!"
33,"Dec 16, 2020","When the two protags seem to be at each other’s throats, there’s an important question to ask... which one had the stronger plot armor? 🤔 lolz"
33,"Dec 16, 2020","So I'm not the only one thats hoping this gets animated one day, right?"
33,"Dec 16, 2020","Junghyeok: Join me and you can be strong! Gilyeong: Not leaving my big brother! 
[You have been gifted 5 coins] "
33,"Dec 16, 2020",When I heard Anna Croft I was like aawwwww snap we a got a tomb raider in OR and then I was like ......nvm that’s Lara Croft 
33,"Dec 16, 2020","I need to re-read this again. Seriously how much do you plan? Also when gilyeong hugged him, my heart melted."
33,"Dec 17, 2020",Did anybody noticed that Dokja did not actually fulfill the “clear conditions”? He survived the scenario but did not occupy a green zone...
33,"Feb 3, 2021","gilyoung/gilyeong calls kim dokja ""hyung/hyeong"" not ""dokja"" and that woman in dokja's backstory calls him ""dokja-yah*"" not ""dokja"". (*-yah - suffix used with close friends or family members as a sign of affection) and lastly, sangah, hyunsung/hyeonseong, heewon/huiwon call dokja ""dokja-ssi*"" not ""dokja"" and vice versa with kim dokja; he also calls them in first name basis but with a '-ssi*' at the end. (*-ssi - literally means mr./ms; used as a polite way to call someone—coworker, etc.) 1/2"
33,"Dec 16, 2020",OH! BEFORE I FORGOT PHYSICAL COPIES OF THIS WEBTOON IS NOW AVAILABLE TO PRE ORDER!!! If you guys are interested please to check it out!! its available in 2 vols with 9 chapters each.
33,"Dec 16, 2020",Anna Croft is probably so confused of my boy Dokja 
33,"Dec 16, 2020",[The constellations of the Webtoon nebula are interested in Dokja’s past and are looking forward to seeing more! 100 coins have been sponsored.]
33,"Dec 16, 2020",I don’t care about most of the translation (like how the names are written etc.) but I really want Gilyeong to call Dojka „Hyung“!!! Whyyyy😭
33,"Feb 3, 2021",I'm sorry but could the translators use the korean honorifics?? i think it would add more emotions and shows their relationship development (the closer you are to a person you can speak casually seen from the honorifics)
33,"Dec 16, 2020",Gilyeong rejecting Junghyeok for Dokja was *chefs kiss* so satisfying 
33,"Dec 16, 2020",Finally we get to have a little insight into Dokja's past! Seems he went through serious trauma 😔 that's probably why he connects so well with Gilyeong
33,"Feb 3, 2021",Dokja's teammates are so wholesome.
33,"Feb 3, 2021",this is the first time he has actually slept since the novel STARTED!
33,"Dec 16, 2020",I wish I was a prophet...so that I can read the rest of this series!!! 😂
33,"Dec 16, 2020",Dokja pulled a pro gamer move and used the rare item from the last Level
33,"Dec 16, 2020",ready player three: anna croft
33,"Jan 28, 2021",Can’t believe it took an apocalypse for Kim Dokja to literally adopt a son 😔
33,"Dec 17, 2020","Croft realized Dokja wasn't Junghyeok because she said he looked Korean, so Junghyeok isn't Korean? "
33,"Dec 16, 2020",As we can see the famous last words of an protagonist .... I will not die I am Legend.... then dies... that’s a big Oof-epic theme song at the end 
33,"Jan 28, 2021"," ""I need to think but I'm too tired."" Same Dokja, same."
33,"Feb 3, 2021","Damn, the constellations in Anna Crofts channel must of gone insane with excitement as soon as Dokja appeared. WHO'S THAT MAN?? WHAT CHANNEL, WHAT STREAM?? "
33,"Feb 3, 2021","Y’all are in for a surprise and a long ride considering this story has over 550 chapters and some of the characters go through major body changes. Honestly I ship you know who and Dokja, I’ve already read a majority of this so know what’s going on but honestly it’s worth the wait."
33,"Dec 16, 2020","[The Constellation of Solo Leveling] insists that the readers ""SHUT UP AND WAIT"""
33,"Feb 3, 2021",I'm sure Jonghyuk is making a mental note of where Gilyoung  was in the train so he could pick him up next regression.
33,"Dec 16, 2020",Awww little Gilyeong had tears in his eyes when he found out Dokja woke up! And that hug! ahh I love the relationship they have! I hope they stay really close. (Because they will NOT die.)
33,"Dec 16, 2020",Become a ghost they said. You wont feel a thing they . . . Life trauma . . . FFFFFFFUCK!!!!
33,"Dec 16, 2020",I’m looking forward to Gilyoung’s growth in abilities considering Jonghyuk saw his potential and tried to recruit him.
33,"Dec 16, 2020",I swear that little kid is slowly becoming more and more badass 
33,"Jan 26, 2021","huh? that skill that detected Dokja's lies is not ""mental barrier"". It should be ""Lie Detection"" skill like in the novel. Mental barrier and Lie Detection are different. PLS FIX THAT. They're not the same skill. Pls people, tell the translators to fix that."
33,"Feb 3, 2021",Dokja: I'm somewhat of a prophet myself.
33,"Feb 3, 2021","I still cant believe that the fourth wall is a skill, usually it would be for humor but it’s really what keeps this story alive "
33,"Dec 16, 2020","Haha Yjh trying to get our gilyoung? Sorry not sorry but its not that easy, bro .. gilyoung is belong to his father 😂"
33,"Feb 3, 2021",oof when you trying not to be the main character makes you the main character
33,"Dec 20, 2020",Favorite WEBTOON by far unordinary don’t got nothing on this
33,"Feb 3, 2021","I wanna point out that Anna Croft didn't use Mental Barrier lv 7 to detect Dokja lying. That was actually Lie Detection lv 7.I know some people may have pointed this out before me, but I wanna add in since this needs to be noticed.
(Such a shame the trabslation doesnt say ""Wait for me across the continent"" or something around those lines, which kinda hints on where she's from. But maybe its obvs from her name and all)"
33,"Jan 27, 2021","ngl boy has excellent photogenic memory, I wish I had that, he can remember every precise little thing from the novel while I can't even remember what'd I study 15 mins ago.. 😶"
33,"Dec 16, 2020","Hypothesis: there is always a non-evil way to survive.  In the first scenario, in addition to insects, it was possible to kill skin mites, for example."
33,"Feb 3, 2021",i forgot we know sh*t about his past
33,"Feb 3, 2021",Gilyeong doesn't give two fcks about anyone but Kim Dokja. My favourite child. Also Yoo Jonghyuk looking good as ever 😳
33,"Feb 3, 2021",i dont even know why we were worried. I mean Dokja legit has sum S rank plot armor like-
33,"Dec 16, 2020","So, hypothetically, can Gilyeong level up his Bug Collector ability enough to control that Monarch Praying Mantis we saw earlier?"
33,"Feb 3, 2021",By far one of the best webcomics 👍 
33,"Dec 17, 2020",Gilyeong probably never made any of the scenarios since Dokja is why he survived the train so I bet his hidden talent is extremely important. I wonder if it's related to him controlling the boss-sized bugs outside?
33,"Feb 3, 2021",dokja is so cool
33,"Feb 4, 2021",It’s funny how the in universe “book” is called “ways of survival” and Dokja is using this book to find “ways to survive”.
33,"Feb 4, 2021","It's nice to read the comics along with the novel. The comics remind me of stuff that I would otherwise have forgotten. That said, Anna Croft used Lie Detection, not Mental Barrier, so there's a bit of an error here. "
33,"Dec 16, 2020",[The constellations of the Webtoon nebula are satisfied with the coins spent and are looking forward to seeing more! 100 coins have been sponsored.]
33,"Feb 7, 2021","so like i decided to read the novel so i could be ahead and o boi i got to ch 300 smth in 3 days. ITS SO FREAKING GOOD. and now im reading it not just to be ahead, but bc of the story in general and im just quietly tryna b patient while waiting for some of my fav scenes to be drawn cuz WOW. 11/10 would def recommend the novel guys. check it out if u want and dont forget to heart the ep!❤️"
33,"Feb 3, 2021","Okay so fangirl moment Anna is now aware of his existence and realizes he was never meant to be because he is in none of her past/present/future visions or memories. Can you understand the anomaly that she must be facing at this moment, that something had slipped past her all seeing gaze and it’s a gosh darn fanfic reader......I personally am screaming inside because this could be me one day 😂"
33,"Dec 16, 2020",Here’s my quick theory...I think Gilyeong is a regressor. This is the only reason why they are talking about who completed what in a sense. I don’t think anything else makes sense to why Jungeok Yu would want him on his team. Just a little theory I hope I’m right it would be really cool! 
33,"Dec 16, 2020",Can we have a moment to appreciate Gilyeong. This boy cares for Dokja so much that he rejected the offer and ran into his arms the minute he saw him wake up. This boy is a fricking cinnamon roll🖐🥺✨
33,"Feb 10, 2021",Dokja and Gilyeong's father and son relationship is one of the best things in this series
33,"Feb 4, 2021",me: pff what do you mean I have a favorite? I love each and every ORV character equally. || also me: *sets reminder for dokja's birthday and his birthday only* (ITS ON FEB 15 BTWWW AKA THIS MONT H)
33,"Feb 4, 2021",“Damn trauma” I think we all feel this way.
33,"Feb 4, 2021","if This kid dies, I'll riot"
33,"Feb 3, 2021",I understand why Gilyeong wants to stay wirh Dokja. He treats him well and take care.
33,"Jan 27, 2021","The best part is Gilyeong rejecting Jungeok Yu right to his face and running to Dokja afterwards!!! Good job, kid!! Lol 😆😂😆"
33,"Feb 6, 2021",Aww I think Gilyeong thinks of Dokja as a father! And he ran straight to him after rejecting The original mc.
33,"Feb 4, 2021","Anna Croft doesn’t use mental barrier to check if Dokja was telling the truth, she used lie detection 😩 Please fix this! "
33,"Feb 3, 2021",i went back to read the prologue... Dokja was so cute while reading TWSA... 
33,"Jan 30, 2021","So Jonghyuk take slot in the greenzone on purpose, borrow the monster's hand to kill Dokja and take Gilyeong under his wings, at first I thought he just being an asshole. Well, Dokja, I guest it would be plans to kill you, again."
33,"Dec 16, 2020","...I just keep using coins on this series. haha. 

where can I read the web novel? 

"
33,"Feb 5, 2021",THE WAY GILYEONG RAN UP TO DOKJA 🥺
33,"Feb 4, 2021",yu junghyeok really has the nerves to try scouting gilyeong after he left hIS HYUNG TO DIE??????
33,"Feb 4, 2021",Wow... his memories were more traumatic then I thought they were going to be. I guess that's why he's a loner who read his entire life. Why is he doubting not being a main character with that kind of background though?
33,"Feb 4, 2021",“I need to think...but I’m too tired” Lmao even tho this is an extreme situation that’s a total MOOD (ﾉಥ益ಥ)ﾉ
33,"Feb 3, 2021",Y'ALL GILYEONG'S LOYALTY TO DOKJA AND HIS REACTION WHEN HE FINALLY WOKE UP IS SO FREAKING ADORABLE. PROTECT GILYEONG AT ALL COST ✊😭
33,"Feb 3, 2021",bruh this Jungeok whatever needs to stay away from  Gilyeong 😀😀
33,"Jan 14, 2021","*Horde of monsters shows up* Dokja: ""Yeah, I'm gonna sit this one out."" *Slides into another dimension* "
33,"Dec 16, 2020",Damn trauma... Always getting in the way. 
33,"Feb 5, 2021",Dokja protec dokja attac dokja’s adopted son has his back
33,"Feb 3, 2021","Awww, Gilyeong is so cute and he chose Dokja over the obvious choice, Jongeok. Now I have to wait for the next episode since I'm broke. Patiently waiting for 6 days, 11 hours, and 59 minutes. >_<"
33,"Feb 3, 2021",gilyeong is so precious and i feel like he’s gonna grow to be really strong too. dokja was right in choosing to help the kid 🥺
33,"Feb 4, 2021",Bad translation... She uses is Lie Detection to tell he is lying NOT Mental Barrier. Why would a skill that blocks mental attacks/prying detect a lie?!?!?!  I cringed reading that. Otherwise great chapter.
33,"Dec 17, 2020","Me everytime a new episode comes out: ""Shut up and take my money!"""
33,"Feb 6, 2021","I’ve refused to read this comic for months SPECIFICALLY so I would have some sweet content to binge read. 
This has been one of the best stories I’ve read on WEBTOON yet!"
33,"Feb 5, 2021",THE WAY DOKJA WAVED AT THE BLONDE GIRL DKLJAWFKJWEJA I'M RUNNING LAPS 🏃‍♀️🏃‍♀️🏃‍♀️
33,"Feb 5, 2021",Gilyeong's relationship with Dojka is just beyond precious ❤️
33,"Feb 4, 2021",🤺Away you heathen🤺 Step away from my child🤺
33,"Feb 4, 2021",this webtoon is too good y'all
33,"Feb 4, 2021","Ummmmm btw Anna Croft used lie detection to detect Dokja was lying, not mental barrier, mental barrier is a skill to block people from entering your mind or reading your stats, etc., not to detect lies"
33,"Feb 4, 2021","Jonghyuk: ""Come with me Kid...you are the chosen one.""Gilyeong: ""P*ss off.""
Dokja: ""That's ma BOI!"""
33,"Feb 3, 2021",Gilyeong used tackle! It was affective!
33,"Feb 3, 2021",I honestly love reading mostly romance but this series gets me hooked on a whole different level.  I love how intricate it is and the level headed actions of the main character makes it so much more mysterious 
33,"Feb 3, 2021",I LOVE GILYEONG SO MUCHHHHHHH HES SO CUTE AND PRECIOUS I WILL PROTECT HIM AT ALL COSTS 
33,"Jan 27, 2021","Dokja simply wasn't made to be a protagonist. He was kinda forced into the position ngl. He's the strategic guy that plans and organizes and is a decent leader, but if he teamed up with Junghyeok... They would bring the world to it's knees."
33,"May 10, 2021",aw you can see sparkles in gilyeong's eyes when he saw that dokja was awake 🥺🥺
33,"May 8, 2021",I knew it!! He WAS looking at Gilyeong! maybe because he can somehow control those large monsters above ground or another power/skill they need to survive a difficult scenario?? The suspense is intense!!!
33,"Apr 29, 2021",Junghyeok wanted Gilyeong because of his potential but Dokja just wanted to keep him safe with him 🥺 And the way Gilyeong run towards him is just too precious??!!! 🥺🥺🥺
33,"Feb 9, 2021","Gilyeong is the cherry on top for this story, hope he doesn't die because if he did, I'll only be happy if the author did what tswa where it resets"
33,"Feb 9, 2021",Technically he is a TYPE of prophet 
33,"Feb 8, 2021",Gilyeong seeing dokja as a dad is cute
33,"Feb 4, 2021",He may be insanely powerful but he's still a kid needs a family to rely on. Dokja is a great example of an older brother sort of like Itachi Uchiha. 
33,"Feb 4, 2021",Ahhh when Gilyeong chose Dokja over Jonghyuk that gave me such a large amount of pleasure just cause it shows Jonghyuk not everyone wants you and also how much Gilyeong is attached to Dokja
33,"Feb 3, 2021","I read and finished the translated webnovel a while back and let me say that it is a masterpiece. Even knowing what's coming next, I still enjoy seeing the story come to life!"
33,"Feb 3, 2021","Oh so Junghyeok sees Gilyeong's potential, which is why he agreed to save him and even took the initiative to do so. But Gilyeong's a loyal lil bean. I love him"
33,"Feb 3, 2021","I must admit, I imagined Anna Croft different. Gilyeong is loyal to dokja uwu "
33,"Feb 3, 2021",Junghyeok said to Gilyeong when did you complete. I wonder if that means that Gilyeong is actually one of the characters in the original story that got scrapped as a side character but because of Dokja he is now one of the mains and he is on his 2nd or higher run of it
33,"Feb 3, 2021",""" I NEED... TO THINK.... BUT I'M TOO....TIRED""THAT'S ME EVERYDAY!!!!!"
33,"Feb 3, 2021",lmao ig Dokja won the custody battle BAHAHAHHA
33,"Feb 3, 2021",such a DAD Im crying
33,"Jan 28, 2021",Jonghyuk and Dokja's relationship is so passive aggressive  heavy emphasis on aggressive. I kind of love it.
33,"Jan 28, 2021",i use the coin to pass the cliffhanger but now I'm struck with another one- .... i- whyyy
33,"Jul 22, 2021","As I’ve said, Gilyeong and Dokja are father and son"
33,"May 6, 2021",A kid rejected your proposal just like that!?Junghyeok you might be the protagonist of TWSA but honey you ain't no protagonist of Omniscient Reader.
33,"Apr 29, 2021",I. love. gilyeong.
33,"Apr 29, 2021",This constellation is happy to have a sneaky peeky in your past
33,"Feb 6, 2021","Everyone is about the translation, the plot armor and Gilyeong but what about the ART! I hate to say it, but Anna Croft looks incredible. When I read the webnovel, my mental character design of her was a bit older. Seeing her though, she gives a youthful, hip vibe that's reminiscent of older fashion. I see those shredded pant cuffs on her jeans. Her level of detail is just amazing. "
33,"Feb 5, 2021",I love how dokja is like a dad to gilyeong
33,"Feb 4, 2021",I've read a lot of webcomics on here but this is the first one that made me spend tokens. I know this is going to be a great just like Tower of God!
33,"Feb 4, 2021",PROTECC GILYOUNG WITH ALL MY HEART!!! 
33,"Feb 3, 2021",My last comment (I’m not gonna die F****** DIES) apparently that was correct he turned into a ghost *pushes glasses up nose* my hypothesis is correct 
33,"Feb 3, 2021",The girl is like in Tokyo Ghoul his eye like Ghouls
33,"Jan 27, 2021","I’m with Gilyeong—when it comes to Dokja, I’m not going anywhere. "
33,"Oct 19, 2021",Gilyeong is so attached to dokja.. wholesome 😭
33,"Oct 12, 2021","""damn trauma"" lmao I love how self-aware he is"
33,"Jun 19, 2021",[A constellation who has never wanted children wants to adopt Gilyeong even more.]
33,"May 9, 2021",When this all is over can we PLEASE have Dokja adopt Gilyeong
33,"May 1, 2021","Ah, forget the girls. I'm so in for the bro-bro relationship between Dokja and Gilyeong, it's too adorable I can't anymore 😆😄 !!! And Yoo Junghyeok covered it up with some sort of a skill and survived, but he was roasted alive when Gilyeong rejected him and ran straight to Dokja. *Pulls out ice pack* ""Apply to burnt areas""."
33,"Feb 13, 2021",ahhh pls gilyeong running to dokja like that 🥺😭 also the fact he’s wanted by jonghyuk!!! Gilyeong has so much potential!! 
33,"Feb 8, 2021","On one hand, I'm so glad that there are no more episodes left cuz I need my s l e e p. BUT I NEED MORE AHBIDFGUOJ"
33,"Feb 6, 2021",Gilyeong and dokja’s relationship is so adorable Dokja should adopt him lol 😂🥺
33,"Feb 6, 2021",Anna Croft looks exactly like I thought she would!! Also Dokja looking pretty cool in that one scene lol
33,"Feb 6, 2021","The Jonghyuk bastard is so insensitive and inappropriate. Gilyeong is alive and has discovered his potential through Dokja. Dokja isn't just ""Lucky to have him"". Dokja is the reason the kid survived, else he would have died in train itself. Dokja is the root of the great potential harbored by Gilyeong. If it were upto Jonghyuk, Gilyeong and the others would die, the only surviver would be the military guy."
33,"Feb 6, 2021",Please stop putting spoilers. Don’t warn and spoil. Don’t hint or tease. Just don’t please. I love hearing about theories and reactions but not the future. Plz no Anna Croft wannabes in the comment section. Thank you
33,"Feb 6, 2021",I already read it on the illegal site but I decided to reread it again on here just in case that somehow supports the author idk

33,"Oct 28, 2021",why did it feel like jonghyuk was fighting for custody of gilyeong
33,"May 13, 2021",I've known all along that Gilyeong is powerfull.
33,"May 13, 2021","I KNEW IT! I KNEW GILYEONH WAS THE ONE EMO BASTARD WAS INTERESTED IN! man, i'm loving the kid more and more by the panel"

33,"May 6, 2021",GILYEONG IS MY PRECIOUS BABY CHILD AND IF HE GETS HURT I WILL- I WILL HURT SOMEONE
33,"Apr 25, 2021",I was just thinking that Gilyeong is so good for his age. What happens when he grows up? He'll be super strong. 
33,"Apr 22, 2021",DOJKA IS SUCH A DAD I’M-
33,"Mar 13, 2021",when gilyeong rejected what's his face it was so satisfying
33,"Feb 14, 2021","Gilyeong has so much potential! But the fact that he chooses Dokja over Jonghyuk is just precious and I LOVE that Gilyeong is always so strong and mature, but when he is with Dokja he is able to be a kid again! 🥰😍"
33,"Feb 7, 2021",so anna croft cant read dokja?? hohohoho how can she when dokja cant read himself lmao the author give him such a special attribute that the system still cant decide what to name it 🤣
33,"Feb 7, 2021",Ain’t gonna lie i’ll be damn happy if Dokja becomes OP or he becomes a real prophet I want the second one to happen more
33,"Feb 6, 2021","Is it me or was the chapter too short. Also THERE ARE COMMENTS FROM DEC 15, damn I am poor."
33,"Feb 6, 2021",I haven't been commenting the entire time I've reading this but just want to say wonderful book so far I'm in love with the characters especially Gilyeong and Dokja
33,"Feb 4, 2021",why is dokja surprised it showed his worst memory when the prison is literally meant to bring up trauma 😂
33,"Feb 4, 2021","Danm, Dokja is turnin into a real snack😍"
33,"Feb 3, 2021",It should be Lie Detection not Mental Barrier. Can you change it? 
33,"May 10, 2021","""idiot child"" iM WHEEZING"
33,"May 3, 2021",GILYEONG I’LL GIVE U A HUG
33,"May 1, 2021",“Damn trauma” ✊😔
33,"Apr 30, 2021",what if the kid was actually the author of the story and he is helping him out because he appreciated that he was the only one in the world to enjoy his story 👍🏾👍🏾👍🏾
33,"Apr 30, 2021",I love that Gilyeong-Dokja relationship they are so cute.
33,"Apr 29, 2021","Again, Dokja secretly building his group of super people because Protagonist is a$$h0le."
33,"Apr 29, 2021",The way he ran for a hug T_T If something happens to this kid I'm gonna kill everyone and then myself
33,"Apr 24, 2021","gilyeong is just too wholesome for me,, my heart"
33,"Feb 25, 2021",Constellation [atrophieduptomyeyes] raises middle finger at JHY smugly at Gilyeon's refusal.
33,"Feb 18, 2021",it's not that hard to believe considering the boy summoned a freaking kaiju
33,"Feb 9, 2021",I read the novel so far back that I genuinely forgot Joonghyuk and Dokja weren't an 'It' at first please I-
33,"Feb 8, 2021",AHSGDGSHEHS IM LIVING FOR THE DOKJA GILYEONG DYNAMIC—THE FATHER SON DUO 👨🤝👦
33,"Feb 6, 2021","This is one of my favorite series, it’s such a unique story and such an interesting world! I can’t wait to read more, thank you author <3"
33,"Feb 6, 2021","I'll say it once, I'll say it again, I'll say it million times - The child is adorable we must protecc him at all costs... 👀🔪"
33,"Feb 5, 2021","superb is an understatement. this story is supernationally beyond amazing. 👏👏👏 great job, author. how do I get coins for free? 😂 i don't want to stop ready. 😭"
33,"Feb 5, 2021",Trauma go brrr
33,"Feb 5, 2021","NO, NO, YOU ARE NOT ALLOWED TO MAKE ANNA THAT HOT"
33,"Feb 5, 2021","A really good adaptation, but the sadness when your mental image doesn't match up with the artist. 😞 I love the interactions, Anna Croft just doesn't look like how I imagined. Still a really great job with the webtoon, I love reading it every week!"
33,"Feb 4, 2021","I'm curious about Gilyeong past. About his parents, and why he's not even trying to look for them."
33,"Feb 3, 2021","In the novel Dokja woke up on Sangah's lap this chapter, it seems they changed it to her folded jacket in the webtoon for some reason"
33,"Feb 3, 2021",so like am i the only person who has to wait because they are poor?
33,"Feb 3, 2021",Considering that Gilyeong could already communicate with Extremely strong monsters at the beginning while his skill is still really low level just shows that he'll eventually become strong enough to probably control every insect boss or maybe even other non-insect creatures. Perhaps he even has better skills that we know nothing about
33,"Feb 3, 2021",Gilyeong and Dokja are so cute
33,"Feb 3, 2021",its my birthday and i wake up to a new comic from my favorout series instantly made my day 
33,"Feb 3, 2021",Gilyeong running to Dokja and hugging him like that is one of my favourite things of all time. Also why does seeing Dokja with a child make him seem more attractive than he already is? It’s not fair 
33,"Feb 3, 2021",If I ate that rock I'd have probably died immediately
33,"Feb 3, 2021","Okay, I'm kinda gay for Anna Croft. She's a looks a lot different than I was expecting because when I read the novel they made it seem that she was pretty young looking, but it is a welcome suprise."
33,"Feb 3, 2021",It's too strange to return to webtoon after having read the novel. I see the hole story with different eyes. (ToT)
33,"Feb 3, 2021",I think Anna’s skill is supposed to be “Lie detection” not “mental barrier”
33,"Feb 3, 2021",Dokja's face when lying to a prophet LOL.
33,"Feb 3, 2021",So Gil is super strong that he's even wanted by Yunghyeok
33,"Feb 3, 2021",Here I am thinking that Anna Croft was a loli or some short character. She a fudging supermodel!
33,"Feb 3, 2021",Gilyeong and Dokja are too sweet please🥺
33,"Jan 27, 2021",Everyone looking so happy to see him awake warms my heart so much 😭🥰
33,"Jan 20, 2021",I CANNOT IMAGINE ANNA AS AN ADULT THO😭😭 I IMAGINED ANNA CROFT AS A KID THE ENTIRE NOVEL
33,"Jan 17, 2021",After reading the webnovel it’s so satisfying to see what other people were imagining from the story! So interesting!! 
33,"Dec 23, 2020","As someone who read the light novel, I love the non light novel readers reaction to this chapter because I had the same reaction in the light novel"
33,"Dec 17, 2020",awwwwwwww Gilyeong's interactions with Dokja are adorable
33,"Dec 16, 2020",I love my insane ghost traumatized boy and kinda want to punch yu in the face for several reasons
33,"Dec 16, 2020","the chapter is short but understandable.anna deserves a chapter dedicated to her. 
and of she wont let yjh to become the orv top model 2020 but kdj just stole it from her"
33,"Jan 12, 2022","I fucking love Dokja and Gilyeong's relationship, look how happy he looked when he ran towards Dokja and the fact that Dojka was worried if Jong laid his hands on him."
33,"Aug 1, 2021","First thought seeing Anna Croft: Oh look, a half-ghoul."
33,"Jul 7, 2021",what if gilyeong is the author of TWSA??
33,"Jul 6, 2021","AW MAN, NOW I WANNA HUG GILYEONG SO MUCHI WANT TO SHOWER HIM WITH LOTS OF HUGS"
33,"Jul 2, 2021","He did totally try to adopt the kid, jokes on you Dokja adopted him first. Also...ooo that memory, dead person and a woman standing over the corpse with light brown hair...wonder who that is. Clearly, he knows them but jeez, that's crazy that he encountered that before getting the scenario to actually happen to him. Also Anna Croft got the eye Dokja traded for and she's an actual prophet, so that's very interesting."
33,"Jun 17, 2021",BROTHERS. they are BROTHERS. this is canon idcidc
33,"Jun 15, 2021",dokja is so lucky that gilyeong had that container of bugs TT
33,"Jun 4, 2021",Gilyeong i think is also someone that completed a run and when back to relive it as in his conversation with the other guy he asked gil when did he complete possibly meaning the runa and something about before possibly meaning a previous run then we get so blurry speaking
33,"May 5, 2021",I love how the kid loves Dokja
33,"May 3, 2021",It's the 1st time a protogonist being hated.
33,"Apr 30, 2021",Soooooo cuttte I have added another name to the list of my fictional children
33,"Apr 29, 2021",I love how Yu claims that he's keeping Dokja alive but in actuality he's been trying to kill Dokja since the day they met😉!
33,"Apr 27, 2021","Gilyeong just said u can't be my other daddy if u don't treat my dad right, bye😂😂"
33,"Feb 24, 2021",*patiently waiting for jungyeok and dokja's fight scene*
33,"Feb 23, 2021",Is anyone else thinking of Lara Croft from tomb raider when he said Anna Croft 
33,"Feb 22, 2021",We novel readers literally feel like we are Kim dokja now. Since we know the future😎.
33,"Feb 11, 2021",gilyeong is so attached to dokja that he even turned a offer to become stronger with a god like person
33,"Feb 9, 2021",I’m thinking Gilyeong is important bec he can control monsters idk
33,"Feb 9, 2021",I'm honestly still not sure if junghyuk is surprised by his sponsor or his stigma...
33,"Feb 8, 2021",I love how much Gilyeong is attached to Dokja 😭😭😭 I really do hope that this two make it to the end okay! 
33,"Feb 8, 2021","just my luck, I binge and it's over when it gets spicy"
33,"Feb 8, 2021",Gilyeong and Dokjaaa omggg my heartttt
33,"Feb 7, 2021",The dynamic between Gilyeong and Dokja is so wholesome aww
33,"Feb 7, 2021","They say dont judge a book by it's cover. Well, this book looks amazing and got me hooked!"
33,"Feb 6, 2021","I was about to write something, but I forgot what. "
33,"Feb 6, 2021",The fact that gilyeong is more loyal than you🤍
33,"Feb 6, 2021",Good job Gilyeong!! Stick with Dokja! Side note.... Gilyeong is just way too cute 😍
33,"Feb 6, 2021",These One-Eyed Ghouls really appearing everywhere.
33,"Feb 6, 2021",Im so glad this web novel was made into a webtoon
33,"Feb 6, 2021","it's just getting better woohoo! I really love this manhwa, and I am looking forward for the next chapters!! "
33,"Feb 5, 2021",If only this was uploaded daily T-T 
33,"Feb 5, 2021","I suspect it may not necessarily be how strong Gilyeong is so much as planning for any potential confrontation with Dokja. Or both, I mean, Gilyeong did summon that giant bug early on. Either way, these chapters are feeling so short now, I can’t get enough, I need my fix!"
33,"Feb 5, 2021","HAHAHA YESS FATHER FIGURE DOKJA, DAMN NEVER THOUGHT I WOULD SAY THIS FOR A FICTIONAL CHARACTER :)"
33,"Feb 5, 2021","""It amplifies the trauma of a person's memories""Me: Goes to the memory of when I farted in class"
33,"Feb 5, 2021","It doesn't work on a real prophet. 🤣. It was really funny. This whole work is really interesting. I can't be a patron but if I could I would definitely be one. Keep up the work. If everyone leaves this work and even if it runs for 10 years, I would be the only one person to read this. Also I draw the attention of the anime industry. If this becomes an anime, I would crush the anime industey if the art quality is even a pinch little worse than this one.Thanks to the author and artists.Stay safe."
33,"Feb 4, 2021","I wanna see my trauma. If I was given a chance to do it, I would. As third person watcher and hopefully not as the first person pov."
33,"Feb 4, 2021",I look forward to reading this every week <3
33,"Feb 4, 2021",The fact that Dokja only kept Gilyeong around to please the constellations... at this rate he's gonna be ready to sacrifice himself for the kid
33,"Feb 4, 2021",All of their faces when dojka woke up 😍 it’s awesome to watch these guys grow as a group 
33,"Feb 4, 2021",Man is pulling all the tricks to survive. This never ceases to surprise me.
33,"Feb 4, 2021",The constalletion [YesHiBye] is intrigued by the new character's appearence.
33,"Feb 4, 2021",lol gilyeong rejected junghyok
33,"Feb 4, 2021","i guess he could say.... ""fùck Yu!"""
33,"Feb 4, 2021",wait bruh junghyeok doesn't even care about dokja to the point that he would kill him were it not for the fact that he's taking care of gilyeong ??? junghyeok doesn't realize what he's missing
33,"Feb 4, 2021","""idiot child"" LHAHSHDHSJAJ"
33,"Feb 4, 2021",Gilyeong and Dokja are so precious like they are the best pair in this whole thing. DOKJA NEEDS TO ADOPT HIM 😭💖😭💖😭
33,"Feb 4, 2021",Mans is always playing 3D chess
33,"Feb 4, 2021","Thank god, the little kid rejected Jungeok yu, he get on my nerves, seeing that he want Dokja dead, why can't he just side with him?"
33,"Feb 4, 2021",I read that WAY too fast
33,"Feb 4, 2021",Stupid trama keeps getting in my way 😂
33,"Feb 3, 2021","Can’t wait for the other baby to come. Probably will happen in the next 30 episodes, though."
33,"Feb 3, 2021",My jaw dropped when it said Dokja became a ghost species. This is one of those series where I just can't predict what's gonna happen next 
33,"Feb 3, 2021",Dokja really isn’t here to play no games huh every interaction and move he makes is well thought through and badass 
33,"Feb 3, 2021","[The Constellation ""Witness of the Endless stories"" is smiling at the past that wants to be hidden] [500 coins have been sponsored]"
33,"Feb 3, 2021",The appearance of Anna croft was way different from my imagination. But this rendering is also amazing
33,"Feb 3, 2021",This junghyeok guy spends his days just looking for dokja later in the novel. Woah. I am really surprised at where they have come lol😂
33,"Feb 3, 2021",Gilyeong rejecting Jonghyuk reminds me of Jiwoo rejecting the principle in Elecced
33,"Feb 3, 2021","Anna Croft seems Legendary. And, OMG Gilyeong rejecting Jonghyuk was a total sight and him going back to hug Dokja was so adorable!!!!! Plus, Dokja's expression when Lady Croft caught him lying. Lolz. #DokjaistheBestProtagonist"
33,"Feb 3, 2021",Ey remember when Dokja was an ordinary office boy. 
33,"Feb 3, 2021",Gilyeong is so effing cute... and since Dokja and him have a father son relationship it's even cuter!!
33,"Feb 3, 2021","I love Dokja, but Gilyeong is my no. 1"
33,"Feb 3, 2021",every episode I get tempted to binge-read the novel but then I realize I'm too pampered with this art work and cant imagine Omniscient Reader without it anymore 🙃
33,"Feb 3, 2021","Damn, Dokja had all this planned from day 1? This man really is OP. Also, for those who think he should have felt more trauma after being turned into a ghost, remember that the 4th wall skill keeps him calm 24/7"
33,"Feb 3, 2021",What Joonghyuk and Gilyeong rlly said: *Joonghyuk: Hey kid join me. *Gilyeong: I think you're a bitch
33,"Feb 3, 2021",And to think that Gilyeong wasn't going to survive the train scenario..
33,"Feb 3, 2021",Gilyeong is the sweetest child I ever saw 💜

33,"Feb 3, 2021",HOLY SHIT THERE'S SO MUCH TO UNPACK IN THIS CHAPTER---
33,"Feb 3, 2021",Ah that was awesome! I definitely didn't expect Anna to pop up and Gilyeong rejecting Junghyeok was awesome and adorable. I wonder what Junghyeok's planning. Man this is good!
33,"Jan 29, 2021",who wouldnt choose dokja i mean he gives hugs and headpats 🙄❗but than again he couldve had the choice to travel with levi ackerman 😔
33,"Jan 29, 2021",I had to fast pass for that cliffhanger 😂
33,"Jan 28, 2021",It's so cute how faithful Gilyeong is Dokja! It's like a father-son relationship.
33,"Jan 28, 2021","Gilyeong is so adorable, I'm guessing that despite being a cute lil kid though, he may be a regressive himself. It's either that or he has a super powerful constellation or some kind of ability backing him. Super excited to see where he goes."
33,"Jan 28, 2021",PLZ WHY IS THIS SERIES ALWAYS SO GOOD
33,"Jan 28, 2021","I love to know that the kid is so powerful that Jungeok Yu wants him, because I adore Gilyeong. He's such a cutie ;) I needed to fast pass, I couldn't bare the suspense of last chapter."
33,"Jan 27, 2021",I love gilyeong with the whole of my heart 💕 I really am not prepared for the heartbreak it will cause me if he died 😭
33,"Jan 27, 2021",Now I'm curious what power Gilyeong holds. Maybe he's able to control Boss Monster? Who knows?...
33,"Jan 27, 2021","okay so gilyeong obviously has some secret power that makes jonghyuk want to take him away from dokja, but if you think about gilyeong wasn't supposed to survive... he's only alive now because dokja saved him on the subway 👀"
33,"Jan 27, 2021",...Mama...just killed a man...
33,"Jan 8, 2021",I'm not a hero... proceeds to be Heroic af 
33,"Jan 4, 2021",Wow over 3000 people are using coins im actually impressed ;O;This webtoon is so good tho so no wonder :b
33,"Dec 16, 2020",Interesting that the prophet thought she was looking at the protagonist at first. lends a bit more weight to my theory that the protagonist and Dojka might actually be the same person in different realities. 
33,"May 20, 2021","What if Gilyoung is also a regressor who originally wrote the novel along his journeys so humanity can survive? Then he finally met Dokja who had interest on his work and hid his identity, that's why he was attached and chose to stay with him. The fact that, he can also control an insect monarch, ackk, oh well, just a theory."
33,"May 8, 2021",I have a theory Dokja is the main character and not YJH because the god like dudes are interested in him and not YJH and when he went in the dream the lady said she was expecting YJH and he’s the main character which makes me think she was expecting the main character and dokja appeared so he might be the main character
33,"Feb 3, 2021",The dilemma of someone who has read the novel. I want to reply to some comments but it would spoil a lot. This is just a warmup guys. The real action is yet to come 😉
33,"Nov 18, 2021","gilyeong is so sweet, was just offered by one of the strongest people to join them but he still stuck with dokja. 10/10 character reminds me of gin from yttd"
33,"Nov 3, 2021",Gilyeong is my favorite character by far. I feel bad for him having to go through so much trauma at a young age and same for dokja like wtf was that panel 
33,"Sep 29, 2021",Sang ah taking off her clothes for Dokja is sooo thoughtful of herr😭 she is too kind
33,"Aug 13, 2021",gilyeong is the best character actually
33,"Jul 17, 2021",gilyeong is a cinnamon roll and the fact that it is said he has so much potential that yjh wanted to take him means he is op huh
33,"Jul 1, 2021","i knew it, that kid must be special i meab even if he is not i love himm"
33,"Jun 4, 2021",okay so it was gilyeong who startled junghyeok.. Just by seeing him you will know he ain't a normal kid
33,"Jun 1, 2021",aweh gilyeong prob thinks of dokja as his older brother or something

33,"May 5, 2021",I LOVE GILYEONG SO MUCH I WOULD DIE FOR HIM
33,"May 4, 2021","so he keeps pointing out he could never be a protagonist but things are changing around him. suppose with his entry he has become to new storyline, and the others are his side characters? he's doing what he read, but the other guys doesn't seem to be"
33,"May 3, 2021",GILHYEONG IS SO PRECIOUS HE'S SO HAPPY TO SEE DOJKA
33,"May 2, 2021","omg, Gilyeong is such a sweetheart, wanna hug him so bad"
33,"May 1, 2021",ok sorry but he has the nerve to touch Gilyeong after he took the green Zone 💥Σ(°д°ﾉ)ﾉ（Ω Д Ω）
33,"May 1, 2021",Gilyeong is so adorable!!!! AND POWERFUL
33,"May 1, 2021","I love our MC, can we replace the original one?"
33,"Apr 30, 2021","I knew that Gilyeong was the powerful one! I mean, doesn't everyone remember that he was capable to order around the great beast mantis on the outside when they where underground in that cave? "
33,"Apr 29, 2021",I just love the dynamic between dokja and gilyeong its so cute
33,"Apr 27, 2021",We must protect Gilyeong at all costs. he is too pure
33,"Apr 17, 2021",One of the best thing here is the relationship between Dokja and Gilyeong. It's so cute!!
33,"Apr 10, 2021","""idiot child"" idk why but that man is funny without even trying 😭"
33,"Apr 6, 2021","completely blew the chance to say ""I'm somewhat of a prophet myself"" "

33,"Feb 12, 2021",kid can grow in power and control that giant mantis. I'd want him on my team too
33,"Feb 11, 2021","the kid is clever enough to think who he needs to follow, nice"
33,"Feb 9, 2021",finally caught up with the episodes!! time for the waiting game... i guess 😞
33,"Feb 6, 2021",I’m so excited wowowowow. Also I’m so happy he helped save the kid because I know he’s an absolute monster. Even more so since the protagonist also chose him. 
33,"Feb 6, 2021",Dokja needs to adopt Gilyeong 🥺
33,"Feb 5, 2021",It has come to my attention that I have become attracted to Dokja and his relationship with Gilyeong only assisted that attraction anyway I will be leaving this here smh
33,"Feb 5, 2021","ok so here's my theory, a couple chapters ago, gilyeong was able to summon monsters 20 times bigger then him to where he was. I think he has the potential to be able to control most if not all monsters in the series. This power mightve also been foreshadowed during chapter 1-3 when gilyeong had a box full of insects. "
33,"Feb 5, 2021","Take a rest, Dokja."
33,"Feb 5, 2021",i love the kiddo so muuuuch

33,"Feb 3, 2021",Man I love this WEBTOON I’m honestly impressed by how much justice it does the web novel tho it’s to bad it will take years to reach the epilogue 
33,"Feb 3, 2021",gilyeong rejecting jeonghyuk reminds me of jiwoo from eleceed
33,"Feb 3, 2021","How long was the webnovel again? I think at this rate, the webtoon won't be finished even in 2-3 years time 🤣"
33,"Feb 3, 2021","Where did the constellations go? Things happened and stuff, r they on a potty break, refilling their snacks, or watching an ad or something?"
33,"Feb 3, 2021",Just when we got a glimpse of his past it really said jokes on you
33,"Feb 3, 2021","Haha get f*cked junghyeok. That’s what happens when you use people as a means to an end. Kids are smart, Gilyeong knows where he’ll be valued more."
33,"Feb 3, 2021",OH MY GOD I CAN’T WAIT TO SEE GILYEONG GROW TO BE THE GREATEST. HE IS SUCH A SWEET BEAUTIFUL BOUNCY BABY BOY RIGHT NOW.
33,"Feb 3, 2021","Sadly, some of the translation is a lil off, I remember reading this episode on the website..."
33,"Feb 3, 2021",everytime dokja opens his mouth to say something i be thinking “what? how am i supposed to know what that means”
33,"Feb 3, 2021","once again, I will say that Gilyeong is just the best."
33,"Feb 3, 2021","i almost thought dokja was flirting with Anna with that ""wait for me"" line"
33,"Feb 3, 2021",i thought anna would look younger but this is also fine 😳😳
33,"Feb 3, 2021",She’s a half Ghoul 😥😥😥😱😱😱
33,"Feb 3, 2021",They lied to him so he could rest... That's so nice of them
33,"Feb 3, 2021","ayee we finally see Anna Croft!! tbh reading the novel, I kinda imagined her as a teen with like shoulder length hair lol but she's hot"
33,"Feb 3, 2021",[The constellation *stressed out student* appreciates how much Gilyeong cares for Dokja 🥺]
33,"Feb 3, 2021",haha boi is still alive. I'm waiting for then to break the green zones. Damn can't wait for the conflict between main hero and main PROTAGONIST. those constellations be mad nosy about his past.
33,"Feb 3, 2021",TT dokja i feel so sad for youuuuuu~ though i’ve been watching the manga of this webtoon so i already knew. But like TT

33,"Jan 28, 2021","When I was reading the novel, I imagined Anna Croft as a shorter woman and with short blond hair... Damn, now I can't get this webtoon version image of Anna Croft out of my head..."

33,"Jan 28, 2021","That child.... that child is more faithful, caring, and everything I ever wanted from Trasha. (If u know u know) They are both amazing stories"
33,"Jan 27, 2021",I am pretty damn sure that Gilyeong might be one of the regressors like Jonghyuk. Readon I think this is because of them talking about “completions” (meaning if they have survived and won the whole apocalypse thing and don’t have to keep going back and redoing it) in there conversation 
33,"Jan 20, 2021","Damn I ran out of coins. Gonna have to sell my clothes, cuz I can't stop reading this "
33,"Jan 13, 2021","""That lucky bastard.""LMAO"
33,"Dec 18, 2020",he needs Dokja to make gilhyeong strong enough tho. otherwise he's useless. Dokja doesn't want Gilhyeong to die cuz of moral reasons. but him keeping gilyeong alive is the only reason jung hasn't killed him 😂🤣
33,"Dec 17, 2020",at the moment I'm just glad Dokja is alive. my skin has been cleansed. 
33,"Dec 16, 2020",Gilyeong is alive! I am so happy! I think he survived via the ability to communicate to bugs.

33,"Apr 29, 2021",Could gilyeong be another regressor like yoonhyuk?
33,"Apr 28, 2021",Reading this again while I wait for more chapters! I like how Dokja has become the cool character. Usually our protagonists have weird dreams/visions of characters that won't be explained until later. But Dokja can be that person for Anna Croft xD

33,"Apr 8, 2021",oh no my baby Gilyoung is crying
33,"Apr 1, 2021","I think people may have been sleeping on Gilyeong. The kid managed to compel an ""Emperor Class"" insect monster... After having his new powers for less than a week. Not to mention that he has adapted to the new world with worrisome ease, even for a child. There are dark depths to that kid and some major hidden powers."
33,"Mar 24, 2021",I don't know why but I've always imagined anna croft as a bratty little girl
33,"Mar 19, 2021",are we gonna ignore the fact that Gilyeongs wasn't supposed to survive the first round but in the end he's so strong that he's wanted even by Junghyuk?

33,"Feb 3, 2021",He said “When did you complete” so maybe this is Gilyeongs however many times rerun similar to Junghyeok? They both came back to do it again? I assume Dokja would know that though.
33,"Feb 3, 2021",everyone's reaction to Dokja waking up was so adorable ESPECIALLY GILYEONG MY BABY HE WAS ALMOST IN TEARS AWW I WANNA ADOPT HIM HE'S ADORABLE

33,"Nov 14, 2021","Gilyeong.... I knew something was up even before this. Gilyeong seemed a little too mature and determined, even for a kid. Also the fact that he connected with that large insect-monster. Dokja was surprised, which means the power eiither isn't in the novel, or stronger than in the novel, or already particularly OP im the novel.
I wonder what Constellation is sponsoring him...."
33,"Oct 11, 2021",If Gilyeong or any of the squad gets killed Ima be throwing hands at the one who killed them >:(
33,"Aug 31, 2021",I’d follow Gilyeong to the ends of the earth 🥺✨

33,"May 21, 2021",I ACTUALLY JUMP INTO A RIDICULOUS CONCLUSION ABOUT GILYEONG OMG HAAHHAHAHAH 
33,"May 5, 2021","i love the kid but he's way too detached poor guy. also, doe anyone understand the timeline? it was the 1st day and now it's the 3rd, so was dokja unconscious the entire time?"
33,"May 4, 2021",Yesssssss!! Gilyeong👏🏾👏🏾
33,"May 4, 2021",gilhyeong is a regressor I think..the way junghyeok said that hints
33,"May 2, 2021",I think the kid is a regresser too. Jungeok said when did you complete? We'll see 
33,"Apr 29, 2021",Lowkey think Gilyeong will end up being the antagonist but like... ya know
33,"Apr 29, 2021",lol that was great also it seems mc does have quite a traumatic past and also well this was cool anyways 
33,"Apr 29, 2021",remember Gilyeong skill to communicate to bugs? maybe he can use it to communicate to not only bugs maybe other animals too plus he even contacted that giant Praying Mantis from before
33,"Apr 28, 2021","hehe he got rejected by a kid good for ma boy. I'm proud, he's so loyal"
33,"Apr 28, 2021","""ghost species'"", ""invisible"", ""amplifies trauma""? Is this symbolism of isolation or something else?"
33,"Apr 27, 2021",Gilyeong is a person of interest for sure; he could summon that gigantic preying mantis.
33,"Apr 27, 2021","I had a hunch... when they defeated that demon servant, Gilyeong tried to find bug to take them back and accidentally called the bug insects monster above ground... That Fabre of his is powerful. No wonder Junhyeok wants him."

33,"Apr 14, 2021",Wha-what? 😰
33,"Apr 13, 2021",Anna Croft seems interesting but what I'm most curious is how uch the constellations were able to see both of that meeting and the illusion
33,"Apr 8, 2021","huh, I always imagined Anna Croft looking like some uptight fancy-ass"
33,"Apr 4, 2021",I knew Gilyeong was gonna be great
33,"Mar 18, 2021",Anna Croft well the art of her was great but in the novel she hotter in there 😂
33,"Mar 18, 2021","idk why, I always imagined Anna croft to be about Gilyeongs size"
33,"Mar 11, 2021",I love his skill of leaving an impression on people 
33,"Mar 11, 2021","Small typo after dokja says he is a prophet as well, the skill anna uses is lie detection not mental barrier"
33,"Mar 11, 2021","Looks like there was an error during translation process.The list of Anna Croft's personal skill is missing ""Lie Detection Lv.7"" (Should be placed between Mental Barrier Lv.6 and Arch-Demon's Gaze Lv.1)
Also, the skill she used to see through Dokja's lie (claiming to be a prophet himself) should be ""Lie Detection Lv.7,"" not ""Mental Barrier Lv.7"""

33,"Feb 3, 2021",THE CHILD IS POWERFUL
33,"Feb 3, 2021",Come on I thought he would wake up in Sangah's lap and she would hug him but of course he would sleeping on the ground and Gilyeong will hug him.

33,"Dec 17, 2020",Gilyeong is so cute i would die for him
33,"Dec 16, 2020",Now I really want to know Dokja past... What kind of Trauma is he holding in
33,"Dec 16, 2020",i cant wait to see who this kid becomes
33,"Dec 16, 2020","Wow, I love this series so much. It's the first one I've ever bought coins for. I can't wait for another episode."
33,"Dec 16, 2020",I know I’m not the only one that’s dying to see the rest of dojkas past😭😭
33,"Dec 16, 2020",I hope Junghyeok loses favor with the prophet so that later Dokja can really pull one over on him.
33,"Dec 16, 2020",Thank you so much for all of your hard work!! It's absolutely beautiful!!!
33,"Dec 16, 2020",Ohhh I got my eye on you for sure... just one 👁😏
33,"Dec 16, 2020",Gilyoung a stronk boi.
33,"Dec 16, 2020",I don't even care any more. Every week I tell myself ill wait for a little longer and not pay for it as I bleed my life's saving 5 coins at a time.
33,"Dec 16, 2020","When your about to die, and almost forgot about the life saving ghost crystals lol, did I ever doubt Dokja, only a little when it first said he was a ghost.And then we meet, the Prophet Anna Croft"
33,"Dec 16, 2020",When Dokja met Anna he was literally looking in the yes of an devil lol but thank god he's alive... AGAIN. Its just melts my heart to see how Gilyoueng cares so much for Dokja i mean the way he rejected Junghyeok was priceless! lol
33,"Dec 16, 2020","Dang this man, plotted from the start! Amazing "
33,"Feb 15, 2021","Gilyeong is my favorite character, I don't care how badass Dokja is, it will never beat pure adorableness."
33,"Feb 3, 2021",again...the second skill Anna used that detected Dokja's lies is NOT MENTAL BARRIER. It should be LIE DETECTION skill. I hope they fix this..but i guess they won't -_-
33,"Feb 3, 2021",haha Dokja has mommy and daddy issues wait this sounds mean I'm sorry Dokja
33,"Jan 27, 2021","so he said im ep 31 that TWSA goes bad because of the MC, Maybe the Novel happened in an alternate world and the author is a constellation or a God that wishes him to Fix it. And maybe Gilyeong is the key for that and Junghyeok know that Dokja will replace him? Just my deduction.."
33,"Dec 16, 2020",Hmmm so curious is the lil man a regressor? So many unanswered questions not enough coins
33,"Dec 16, 2020","Gilyeong has my whole heart & soul.. Wish they let him call Dokja ""Hyung"" coz its one of the cutest things ever from the novel. Also, the kid's not just cute, but also hella powerful? That's a badass slaying in all departments & he's still so (Gil)young!!"
33,"Dec 16, 2020",could the constellations see Dokja when he was a ghost?

33,"Jun 3, 2022",I like many readers have hoped that this webtoon much like twsa will have 3000 plus chapters.As of posting this comment there are 101.This is my 5th time reading this and I'm only just now registering that as of chapter 101 they are very much so still in korea.Its surprisingly easy to forget that the same thing is hapening in the rest of the world.Theres tons of potential for travel to other country's which very well could bring this to thousands of chapter which I very much so hope it does!!
33,"May 28, 2022",anna croft seems so cool

33,"Nov 2, 2021",thats rlly intense
33,"Oct 23, 2021",so cute and wholesome and just happy ahhhhhhh
33,"Oct 14, 2021","Maybe when Gilyoung’s ability advances, he’ll be able to do some sort of manipulation on insects and insect monsters"
33,"Oct 1, 2021",WOAH WOAH WOAH JUNGHYEOK WHAT R U SCHEMING THERE ?!?!? WOAH ........ WAIT A MINUTE ..... GILYEONG ..... HMMM WOAH
33,"Sep 4, 2021",“You have become a ghost species” me rn after just reading it: ….come again?!?!
33,"Aug 27, 2021","Looks like Dokja's mother was a victim of abuse who turned on her abuser. It would explain why he speaks so fondly of her. 4th wall is OP. Not only can it block mental attacks, it can also stop people from viewing his stats or having his future peered into. He is the author of his own destiny and as such can probably change the future. Gilyeong is a beast in the making. Goes to show everyone has potential and Junghyeok shouldn't toss people aside so casually"
33,"Aug 24, 2021","I think the readon Gil has developed so much is because he was with Dokja or else it would have been the military dude becuse if Dokja wasn't there, he would have gone with Jung and then he would have become better and also I think, outlr Dokha is turning into the protagonist, slowly because and maybe Anna Croft was trying to contact yhe person who will end this and it contacted Dokja??? I tbh don't know, [CONSTELLATION LUNA IS SATISFIED WITH THE OUTCOME OF THIS SCENARIO] "

33,"May 28, 2021",Wai- a one eyed Ghoul!?! 
33,"May 5, 2021","Oh the protagonist got shocked lol. Poor Gilyeong, he's crying. Wait what the hell did just happened? How did Dokja became a ghost? Hmm what's that memory? I can't believe the 4th wall skill got decreased. Dokja is having some flashbacks, or shall I say, foreshadowing? Gosh who's this new character? She knows how to use sharingan. WOAH A Legendary Character with some real superpower. Haha Dokja's lie failed. Dispel evil? What kind of skill is that? Oh so there's still 4 days left."

33,"Feb 4, 2021","Can someone who's read ahead please explain without spoiling- the part with anna Croft.. I'm so confused how he suddenly met her? He became a ghost so the monsters wouldn't see him, started to relive traumas, and then out of nowhere she appeared and they converse? So confused"
33,"Feb 3, 2021","Guys, I think Jongeok and Gilyeong were talking about a game! This may be the most retarded guess ever, but Gilyeong is a kid and Jongeok was a professional gamer, and they were talking about if they finished “it”, this “it” must just be a video game."

33,"Dec 16, 2020","gilyoung had potential i knew it the moment he summoned a giant monarch by accident but I think everyone will continue to have increased potential, especially the ones who were not in the original story "
33,"Dec 16, 2020",I really just can’t take my eye off you👁... that’s what she’s really saying 😏
33,"Sep 27, 2022","[The constellation ""The Shadow Scholar"" is happy that Gilyeong's loyalty.] [100 coins have been gifted,]"
33,"Sep 26, 2022",I forgot how gilyeong acted towards YJH in the beginning. It’s nice to be surprised by rereading (true but I’m lying in this instance). Y is my memory so bad
33,"Sep 21, 2022",That bug kid will become a gym leader one day.
33,"Sep 21, 2022",Gilyeong you loyal little child i love you so much mwah

33,"Jul 22, 2022","Based on the little we heard of the conversation between Jonghyuk and Gilyeong, I'm going to assume that Gilyeong has either played this before or (if I'm lucky) he's the author."
33,"Jul 4, 2022",Now I'm really curious to know who author of TWSA and how powerful they are 1o1
33,"Jul 2, 2022","so the recent stuff with gilyeong (willingness to survive, overwhelming potential, jonghyuks interest in him) have caused me to look into something and if u got back a few chapters the silhouette of the tenth evil has eerily similar hair to gilyeong. i'm almost certainly wrong and i'm definitely overthinking it but i'm just putting it on the record"
33,"Jun 26, 2022",Imagine trying to sleep but a child is on u
33,"Jun 21, 2022",AAA GILYEONG AND DOKJA 😩 i can't believe junghyeok wanted gilyeong but gilyeong still chooses dokja 😩😩

33,"Jun 6, 2022",Did he really just chew down a stone?? 😳😳😳

33,"May 15, 2022",two protagonist sure is hard to maintain in one story
33,"May 2, 2022",I had a feeling he wasn't looking at the girl but at Gilyeong! probably a skill he needs
33,"Apr 30, 2022",Jungeok being interested in Gilyeong?? Man this kid might be powerful
33,"Apr 8, 2022",Is it just me or does that girl with Jonghyuk seem jealous and want to join Dokja’s group?
33,"Mar 27, 2022",Waiting the moment Gilyeong calls him Hyung instead of Dokja cause it’s so weird to see him not use honorific lmao

33,"Jan 7, 2022",Is this why he said his mom would survive? 🤔

33,"Dec 4, 2021",The constellation DARK FLAME PHOENIX smiles at the incarnation Dokja for being smart in moments.The constellation DARK FLAME PHOENIX is liking the look of worry on Junghyeuk yu's face for his companion Dokja.
33,"Nov 11, 2021",He is loyal and of course he must really like dokja
33,"Nov 2, 2021","gilyeong potential OP and loyalty +++. dokja is so much better than a protagonist- he is a reader who like us gets frustrated over character's choices, and so he has the chance to do what he thinks should have been done. And also that face he made when caught lying....🤣🤣🤣"
33,"Oct 1, 2021",.
33,"Oct 1, 2021",dokja just did rumble 
33,"Sep 23, 2021",So this story is about how Jonghyuk the actual protagonist becomes an antagonist?
33,"Sep 19, 2021",someone can spoil me in which chapter will I get to see Dokja backstory? 🙊 
33,"Sep 6, 2021",:0 i read this character Anna Croft existed but i didn't think she'd appear this soon
33,"Sep 4, 2021",YALL. I CANT WITH THIS GIYLOENG AND DOKJA RELATIONSHIP. TOO. CUTE.
33,"Aug 24, 2021","Elaborating on the Anna Croft thing. I think its like, she is a prphoet so she might have tried to see how this apocalypse ends, right? so I think, she was taken to Dokja's consciousness when he was the most vulnerable and now it Dokja, who is the protagonist?? "
33,"Aug 19, 2021",there should probably be a story that shows the original main character point of view of what's going on (sorry not good with names)
33,"Aug 8, 2021","Okay, prediction, Dokja dies and his companions take over the rest of the story. "
33,"Aug 8, 2021",Day 32 of voicing all the characters 
33,"Aug 6, 2021",Does Anna Croft not have a supporting constellation?
33,"Jul 31, 2021",Gilyeong is definitely going to communicate with that giant pray mantis (not a spoiler i havn't read ahead lol)

33,"Mar 12, 2021",looks like Gilyeong is regressor too. Maybe he remembered his previous lives when they were in illusionary prison
33,"Mar 12, 2021",did the kid complete the story before!?
33,"Mar 11, 2021","Not bad, kid."
33,"Mar 9, 2021",I think Gilyeong is also a regressor..

She kind of looks like Sung Jin Woo’s girlfriend."

33,"Sep 17, 2022",Me reading this with calm music in the background：🙂 Everything is Fine
33,"Sep 15, 2022",Based on the bit of the conversation we picked up on. I'm guessing that Gilyeong is also a regressor like JHY
33,"Sep 8, 2022","also, I just realized that anna was able to see him because of her clearvoyance skill. I just didn't know how far clearvoyance can see people, so she has to be near by right ?"
33,"Sep 8, 2022",Did he just call my child an idiot?! 
33,"Sep 6, 2022",wow love their friendship
33,"Sep 6, 2022","Did this mf just try to steal Dokja’s companion, is that why the mf stayed in the green zone while he probably didn’t need to 🥴 annoying"
33,"Aug 31, 2022","what does Anna mean when she said ""you look Korean"" when trying to find junghyeok? is junghyeok not Korean at all 😓"

33,"Aug 22, 2022","Damn, iirc I don't think the novel covers the part of Dokja's trauma, can't really blame them for sort of spoiling this"
33,"Aug 19, 2022",i knew gilyeong was special 🙇🏻‍♀️
33,"Aug 11, 2022",i thought junghyeok was curious of sangah since sangah is the only character that dokja can't read
33,"Aug 5, 2022",Dokja is f*cking good character like sung jin from solo levelling
33,"Aug 5, 2022",32
33,"Aug 3, 2022","literallt no one can spell junghyeok right, i dont even know if i did"

33,"Apr 28, 2022",I'm calling it now Dokja I gonna do something stupid and make Gilyeong leave and go with Jungkook Yu and a few eps later  he's gonna come fight him with a maxed Tanjiro sword
33,"Apr 27, 2022",i seriously love their relationship ❤ like brothers? father-son relationship? or something else more unique~ and the fact that Dokja changes fhe storyline from the beginning means Gilyeong and So... (forgotten that orange hair lady that was Dokja's collegue name) are the new 'main characters' that never appeared in the TWSA before....  with probably some overpowered skills! 
33,"Apr 24, 2022",well in the novel dokja asked yoo sangah for going to sleep and they changed it in manhwa I'm glad 
33,"Apr 23, 2022",the fact that dokja was a complete loser before is wow seeing how he is now
