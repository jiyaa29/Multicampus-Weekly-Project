Episode,Date,Review
67,"Aug 25, 2021","I'm not sure I like the translation of Dokja's fable here. sure ""King of the World without a King"" is technically correct but ""King of a Kingless World"" sounds better. It's easier to say at least."
67,"Aug 25, 2021",The starts are beautiful at night aren’t they…In a **Kingless World ✨🌌
67,"Aug 25, 2021","Please change ""ruler of the dark dimension"" to ""outer god"". The Aliens -> Outer gods we saw in ch42 was a mistake on the fandom's part, as the KR ver said 이계인들 (people from another world), not 이계의 신격 (gods from another world/outer gods). The real 이계의 신격 appears in this chapter, but is now translated as ""ruler of the dark dimension"", which gives no context as ""outer god"" does. Edit: There's a list of LINE's mistranslations by u/lololwarrior, if you want to know all their mistakes so far."
67,"Aug 25, 2021",[The constellation 'Lazy Broke Weeb ' is looking at you.]
67,"Aug 25, 2021",Nobody can tell me this chapter wasn’t a movie I just watched in IMAX
67,"Aug 25, 2021",The constellations taking the burden from dokja was awesome it’s just letting you know even the constellations are much more interested in an alternate fable 
67,"Aug 25, 2021",The fact that he didn’t expect the constellations to share the burden and the fact they did is so cool and heart warming 
67,"Aug 25, 2021",Am I the only one who got literal chills when the constellations all teamed up to share the burden?
67,"Aug 25, 2021","I would love to play a game where an achievement popped with ""you've done something so rad and unheard of that we created this specifically because of you."""
67,"Aug 25, 2021",Dokja has achieved more in one regression than Junyeok did in like 80
67,"Aug 25, 2021",I sponsor this episode to share the burden of financial stress with the Author [5 Coins Spent]
67,"Aug 25, 2021","[The fable the king of the World without a King, has been created]. Guys, it's his FIRST FABLE. I'm getting emotional 🥺🥺. This is the beginning. Super excited for the future chapter. [5 coins has been sponsored] "
67,"Aug 25, 2021",KING OF A KINGLESS WORLD!!!!
67,"Aug 25, 2021",This would make such an amazing anime. Which constellation do I have to pay to make that happen?
67,"Aug 25, 2021","God, I love this story. So many twist and turns yet so well written. 10/10"
67,"Aug 25, 2021","He's not the protagonist we were promised, but he's the one we got. All Hail the King of the Kingless!"
67,"Aug 25, 2021",This webtoon is so visually stunning that I just can't. Like the way those speech bubbles overlapped to show that the constellations speak simultaneously. Wow.
67,"Aug 25, 2021","As each constellation looked at him to share his burden, it made me tear up a little. Dokja making friends everywhere."
67,"Aug 25, 2021",CHILLS. LITERAL CHILLS. WORTH EVERY CENT.
67,"Aug 25, 2021","[The Constellation, LADY OF THE SINGULAR FOOTWEAR, is stunned into awed silence. 5 coins have been gifted]"
67,"Aug 25, 2021",I really enjoy seeing dokaebis get mad 
67,"Aug 25, 2021",I literally cannot throw money at my screen hard enough for this title. 
67,"Aug 25, 2021",If you didn't get goosebumps did you even read the chapter ✋🤨
67,"Aug 25, 2021",By far one of the best webtoons on this app
67,"Aug 29, 2021","There's a thousand titles that Dokja could have, and all of them are badass. But [King of the Kingless World] is better than all of them. [The Constellation Lord of the Bleeding Wallet is looking at the author][5 coins have been sponsored]"
67,"Aug 25, 2021",Oh my God this chapter just gave me chills...that panel with Dokja under the rain is incredible!
67,"Aug 25, 2021",this series keeps getting better and better 
67,"Aug 25, 2021",So he just became his own constellation?
67,"Aug 25, 2021","[The Constellation 'Lonesome Dragon' believes King of a Kingless world sounds like a worthy title for Dokja, he wants to see the end of his story as well] [5 coins have been sponsored]"
67,"Aug 25, 2021",I do not regret spending the coins I have on this.
67,"Aug 25, 2021",BIG SHOUT-OUT TO YI SUNSIN [MARITIME WAR GOD] FOR BEING THE FIRST CONSTELLATION TO SHARE KDJ'S PROBABILITY!!
67,"Sep 29, 2021","The declaration of Dokja's fable in gold was so great! I was scared for the translation of the fable, and even though it is a bit of a mouthful compared to King of a Kingless World, I'm fine with it. If anyone was wondering, plausibility is the 'chance of something' happening, since destroying the throne by borrowing the constellation's powers has never been achieved before and is 'not plausible' to a point, Dokja suffers  adverse effects. Sorry if it's still not clear."
67,"Aug 26, 2021","i don't know man. king of a kingless world rolls off the tongue more smoothly but ""king of a world without a king"" sounds like a title of a story or in this case, a fable."
67,"Aug 25, 2021",Still thinking about how that little girl barfed up a flag pole
67,"Aug 28, 2021","""I will end the STORY of this world"" 😥🤗 all along, he wanted to save his friends from becoming characters, remain human. POWERFUL WORDS! Now, they begin their own path 😄 "
67,"Aug 27, 2021","Out of all of Omniscient Reader, the first Fable is probably my favorite, and this was an amazing adaptation.Definitely think the translator should stick with ""King of a Kingless World"" rather than the current, as some others have pointed out.
Also, I don' think it was meant to be Ruler of the Dark Dimension, unless that is going to be the official TL from now on. May need to clarify because that sounds pretty easily confusable with the Demons."
67,"Aug 25, 2021","that last panel has me feeling a jumble of emotions, his expression is just...I don't even have a word for it. I feel like I need to re-read from the beginning and make a glossary as I go cuz I know something big happened with the new fable being created but I feel like my brain isn't fully grasping the magnitude of it. "
67,"Aug 29, 2021",I got emotional when they started to share the burden. I’m such a big old baby. 😭
67,"Aug 25, 2021",I can't explain how moving it was to see Dokja risk his life to show the constellations a new and better story. I couldn't say I would be willing to do the same. Be more like Dokja.
67,"Sep 23, 2021",The there is NO NEXT REGRESSION for me in this world really open your eyes that they won't have 2nd chance in life once their luck runs out.
67,"Aug 26, 2021","I know this is based on a novel so I really wanna go read it right now, assuming there's a translated version out there, but at the same time I know myself well enough to say that there's a 99% chance that I'll never return to this Webtoon if I do because my brain gets bored with repeating stories and I really REALLY wanna keep supporting this Webtoon!"
67,"Aug 25, 2021",Wait—so has our boi gone from reader to author?
67,"Aug 26, 2021","This was so epic. The constellations coming together to help him, his speech about using the descendants for power. Everyone banding together and trusting him. Just... dang. I wasn't expecting all of this. So good! 🔥🔥🔥"
67,"Aug 25, 2021",king of the world without a king is such a mouthful tbh
67,"Sep 29, 2021","I wasn't sure about Dokja as a protagonist because it felt like everything he was doing, no matter how good it seemed, was ultimately self-serving. Now we see what his real end goal was, not to survive, but to make sure the world makes it through. That's a hero worth believing in."
67,"Sep 29, 2021",Imagine being so badass that you unlock a non-existing achievement and the universe creates a whole freaking FABLE in your name
67,"Sep 30, 2021",this webtoon has no reason to slap this much every single week
67,"Sep 29, 2021","To everyone asking for anime adaptation, According to this (https://www.starwatcher.com.tw/edm/orv/#) orv is getting an animated series, live action, and game adaptation. Webtoons official had confirmed it on their insta and twitter too, here's the link to the tweet (https://twitter.com/webtoonofficial/status/1343759419306176514?s=19). I think the author confirmed the live adaptation on their social media some time ago. Let's hope the adaptations will follow the source material faithfully. "
67,"Aug 25, 2021","I love this. This is the type of story I’ve been looking for, to read. Drama, adventure, action, with emotional twist and turns. Great writing and great art, I just love it."
67,"Sep 29, 2021",this webtoon is a master piece.
67,"Aug 27, 2021",so... Netflix adaptation when?
67,"Aug 27, 2021",Tell me why I cried when they split the burden between them!?!
67,"Sep 29, 2021","translation mistakes aside, CAN WE TALK ABOUT HOW ABSOLUTELY BEAUTIFUL THIS EPISODE WAS (AND HONESTLY ALL LAST 3 EP) I TOOK SO MANY SCREENSHOTS. I LITERALLY CAN'T COMPREHEND HOW THE ARTISTS DREW THESE. INLOVE YALL. I WOULD LIKE TO GIVE MY NON EXISTING FORTUNE TO THE ARTISTS. I just.. wow. just absolutely wow"
67,"Sep 29, 2021","Okay, Dokja is starting to fight for that certain story he wants, to reach the epilogue he desires, and I am here for it. The stars shined brightly on the sky of the kingless world… "
67,"Aug 27, 2021",Watching them share the burden and declare a new fable is just real. Even they are tired of this system and it's exploitation.
67,"Sep 30, 2021","i want ""king of a kingless world"" back please"
67,"Aug 29, 2021","Honestly this chapter for me atleast was probably one of the best so far in this series, he even looked surprised at the end, I just love it"
67,"Sep 30, 2021",King of a Kingless world just has a better ring to it…
67,"Sep 30, 2021",This man just keeps getting cooler and cooler 🙀
67,"Aug 25, 2021","some of these panels of dokja taking on the plasibility storm is a bit like uh,, i wont say anything-"
67,"Aug 26, 2021","I'm gonna explain few things based on this webtoon version of translation so new readers won't be too confused, do correct me if I'm wrong:Constellations known to have 3 levels; highest is Mythical (means Myth-grade), next is Fabled (means Fable-grade), last is Historical (History-grade). Term ""Fable"" used in this chapter is not referring to Constellation's grade but the essence of someone's power in ORV. When one's achievement is significant and recognised by Star Stream, they earn a Fable. "
67,"Sep 29, 2021",DOKJA YOUVE ALWAYS BEEN A KING IN MY EYES 🥺🥰💕
67,"Sep 29, 2021","Ok. So 'fables' were called 'stories' in the novel. Earning a fable does not equate becoming a fable constellation. All constellation have accumulated fables, and incarnations can accumulate fables as well. The accumulated fables make up the constellation's power in their case, and that's why their ranked- usually by how well-known their fables are. I saw a few people getting confused over this, I don't have the biggest issue with the translation change but it's starting to cause confusion."
67,"Aug 25, 2021",did this seem short? I know it wasnt short but it seemed short...am I just being greedy? I want more...here are my 5 🪙...I will pay more 😭
67,"Sep 30, 2021","The last panel is so beautiful. You can see the pain on his face, but his determination is strong."
67,"Sep 30, 2021",So we all agree that King of a Kingless World sounds so much better and that’s the translation we’ll be using right? 
67,"Sep 30, 2021","I BLESS EVERYONE THAT ARE INVOLVE IN THIS WEBTOON TO HAVE CLEAR SKIN, GOOD MEALS, AND MAY ODDS BE IN THEIR FAVOR AT THE END OF THE DAY. THANK YOU FOR THIS MASTERPIECE"
67,"Aug 25, 2021","And so the story begins. This feels like the prologue. Now I am excited to see how each character develops their abilities, new constellations to be introduced and the wonderful new items ! Thank you for this great adventure 💙"
67,"Sep 30, 2021",who else had Goosebumps when the constellations started looking down on him? 
67,"Sep 30, 2021",King of a Kingless World just hits different why does the novel names and fan translated always hit better 😩
67,"Sep 30, 2021",Wow I got goosebumps. Thank you for this
67,"Sep 30, 2021","having not read the book, i am LOSING my shit here"
67,"Sep 29, 2021","I appreciate the people correcting the translations, but sometimes I just want to go to the comments and talk about how cool the chapter was. Most of the time I don't even care about the miss-transaltions"
67,"Sep 29, 2021",Round of applause for this episode 👏👏👏👏👏 Goddamn that was amazing
67,"Sep 29, 2021",This episode was REVOLUTIONARY. THANK YOU AUTHOR :D
67,"Sep 29, 2021",If he becomes important enough could he become a constellation 
67,"Sep 22, 2021","The writing, the story telling, the climax, and the ending of this one episode is just utterly outstanding. Chills, just chills. It's so beautifully written and I'm not going to miss a single bit of this, because it's amazing."
67,"Nov 12, 2021","i got rising chills as more constellations looked at him, god i love this webtoon "
67,"Oct 13, 2021","chills, literal chills from this chapter"
67,"Oct 6, 2021",King of the Kingless World
67,"Oct 4, 2021","""you have achieved a nonexistant achievement."" Yeah,  that sounds plausible. "
67,"Oct 1, 2021",I was mesmerized by the way they stacked the speech bubbles to indicate there are multiple voices but damn I didn't expect that emotional scene at all..... got me teared up with the togetherness trope lmao I'm weak with that trope. But seriously how dokja can think of anything so clearly every time is a bit too OP lol I don't think I could react like him even if I got isekai'd to my favorite mmorpg that I've played for 8 years. Surely I'd make a lot of blunders and doubting myself lol
67,"Oct 1, 2021","MY HEART- Please, I wish everyone who has Webtoon reads this. It deserves every single adaptation known to mankind for being so fcking amazing ❤️❤️❤️"
67,"Sep 30, 2021",Man this series Rocks!!!! I legit started to tear up when the constellations saved him.  
67,"Sep 30, 2021",The GUY just unlocked A HIFDEN ACHIVMENT!
67,"Sep 30, 2021",Damn what a good chapter
67,"Sep 30, 2021",I love the subtle change of the raindrops on the title/logo.
67,"Sep 29, 2021","I know translating webtoon is hard, so thank you for your effort despite the barrage of criticism, but I'd hoped the translators take care with the research and the phrasing more...? I've noticed several times that some choice of translations removed a good chunk of foreshadowings. it makes me sad."
67,"Sep 29, 2021",what kind of anime finale heartstrings pulling shit is this??? how DARE you make me emotional?!!
67,"Sep 29, 2021",A feat so great that you are awarded an achievement that doesn’t exist. That’s beyond true gaming. 
67,"Sep 8, 2021","Although the webtoon's translation is okay, there's so much mistranslation and better words they could've used. ""King of a World without a King"" is one big missed opportunity to just put ""King of a Kingless World"" as it sounds better. Idk about the other translations but I hope webtoon could hear out the readers and use the right/better  translation. "
67,"Sep 2, 2021",I’m not crying your crying 
67,"Aug 26, 2021",man Binyeongs streaming channel must be soaring through the roof i wanna see his reaction 
67,"Aug 25, 2021","As strong as this chapter is, there are some things it can be improved on, translation wise. Like 'King of a world without a king' would have sounded better as 'King of a Kingless World' because during the last 5 players involved yeah they were kings but are they still after losing, since there is only supposed to be one King in the end to take the throne but he destroyed it. So the other 'kings' wouldn't be kings anymore after losing, if I saw how the event worked. "
67,"Aug 25, 2021",Damn! Actual chills at the end there
67,"Oct 24, 2021",One of my favorite chapters. The art was gorgeous and the pacing and paneling was done really well
67,"Oct 12, 2021",that was beautiful...
67,"Oct 6, 2021",when you become the main character 😭😭
67,"Oct 5, 2021","*wipes tear* I'm waiting for you in the ■■■, Dokja ✨"
67,"Oct 3, 2021","I literally cried at the end, it's so damn good, and as a novel reader who loves this story heartily, the importance of this fable and the emotions I felt this chapter... ahhhh it was soooo good.. the only thing I didn't like is the webtoon using ""king of the world without a king"" instead of ""king of kingless world"", I feel so attached to the latter. And all these stars/constellations sharing the aftermath of plausibility is heart warming, I also like how his friends were so worried for him "
67,"Oct 3, 2021",All the top comments are about translation mistakes are we not gonna acknowledge how fucking badass that was
67,"Oct 2, 2021",he made all the constellations so intrigued by him that they want him to live ✋😭
67,"Sep 30, 2021",This arc is so beautiful. 
67,"Sep 30, 2021","The constellations are watching a show run how they’ve never seen it run before! They’ve grown to like him and his interesting tale..watching him die would bring only sorrow for them, so they’re helping him live; they can’t allow their show to end, a show with it’s most interesting character gone is no longer as interesting or special."
67,"Sep 30, 2021",I like other translations better “king of a kingless world”
67,"Sep 29, 2021","Dokja ""I'm going to do what's called a pro gamer move.""Proceeds to destroy major plot device. Intern creating a brand new story."
67,"Sep 29, 2021",why did this feel so so so uh idk how to explain but like powerful
67,"Sep 29, 2021",did anyone else cry when the constellations shares the plausibility? no? just me? ok
67,"Sep 29, 2021",holy shit the last panel... beautiful 
67,"Sep 29, 2021",Whoever said Dokja wasnt hot is wrong
67,"Sep 25, 2021",SHEEEESH this chapter gave me literal chills.. Dokja is so COOL😭❤️
67,"Aug 26, 2021","The first tale of this story has been aquired. I'm getting goosebumps. 
The fact that the webtoon art is still so stellar not only does the novel justice but brings more depth and heightens expirence in a story that captures first readers and the novel readers. Seeing what wasn't described and what was. Rereading at its finest. 👌"
67,"Nov 15, 2021",Dokja you might not be a King there but in our heart you are the King of Kings👑
67,"Nov 12, 2021",I got chills 
67,"Oct 16, 2021",damn i actually teared up this chapter was so good!!!
67,"Oct 12, 2021",Does this mean that there's a possibility of Dokja becoming a constellation?
67,"Oct 9, 2021",I got chills seeing the constellations share his burden whoa this story is so good
67,"Oct 3, 2021","should have use ""King of a Kingless World"" but regardless, this chapter always gives me chills 😭"
67,"Oct 2, 2021",all hail king of kingless world
67,"Oct 2, 2021",Bro my man out here creating fables
67,"Oct 1, 2021",Did he just become a freakin constellation?

67,"Sep 30, 2021",all I can is COOL DOKJA (灬º‿º灬)♡
67,"Sep 30, 2021",goddamn I'm teary-eyed from all this epicness and got goosebumps all over xd fan-fucking-tastic episode holy shittttt
67,"Sep 30, 2021","Damn, reading this scene in the novel and seeing in picture form really gripped my throat more than I thought.It's really the end of the tutorial soon and into grand adventures! "
67,"Sep 30, 2021",bro this was the best episode
67,"Sep 30, 2021",Anyone else just feel extremely satisfied with how every little action and choice Dokja made has lead to this glorious moment? Cause I'm just floating on cloud 9
67,"Sep 30, 2021",those constellation poppings are really giving me goosebumps
67,"Sep 30, 2021"," ""Stars. I can see the stars again, m'lady” like if you get it 🥲😭🤚"
67,"Sep 30, 2021",Chills literal chills
67,"Sep 30, 2021",Now that is how you go from side character to main character!  MC!  lol
67,"Sep 29, 2021",i need this to be an anime
67,"Sep 29, 2021","wait, ""we will remember you"" does that mean, when he dies he'll become a constellation?"
67,"Sep 29, 2021",I think this is one of my favourite epsiodes😆
67,"Sep 29, 2021","I was so impressed with this episode, and completely surprised/disheartened that the three top comments are critiques. This episode was SO good, please keep it up! "

67,"Sep 29, 2021",I'm crying 😭 the constellations sharing his plausibility is too much for my heart 
67,"Sep 29, 2021",I feel like every new chapter is my new favorite chapter. This was STUNNING. All hail the King of the Kingless World! ❤️❤️
67,"Sep 29, 2021",(The constellation reader of the reader of the world smiles upon you)
67,"Sep 29, 2021",When the constellations started looking at him one by one... Oh god that scene was awesome !!
67,"Sep 29, 2021","I know the majority of manhwas/comics are based off of light novels but I think this is one of the first where I’ve been willing to read the actual light novel. The plot did that much of a good job. Props to singnsong tbh, this story is absolutely amazing, probably the best on this app period"
67,"Aug 29, 2021","I CANT FUCKING WAIT, I WANT MOREEEEEEEEEEEEE"
67,"Aug 25, 2021",Again the illustrators come with amazing adaptation of the text to image. I love how they display constellations speaking to Dokja.
67,"Aug 25, 2021",I’m sorry but can we stop complaining about the translation? This was such an amazing and awesome chapter that should be praised. I loved every part of this!!
67,"Aug 25, 2021",That feeling when you're glad you invested all that time into side quests

67,"Sep 30, 2021",m imagining a Netflix series lol
67,"Sep 30, 2021",The storytelling of this webtoon is unmatched! Each chapter tops the last! They need to adapt this into an anime asap 🔥🔥🔥
67,"Sep 29, 2021",This is why Omniscient Reader is my favorite webtoon
67,"Sep 29, 2021",absolutely stunning. from art to story. magnificent.
67,"Sep 29, 2021",it somehow made me a lil emotional when all those screen messages of the various Constellations showed up helping him burden the plausibility. dokja is pretty amazing 
67,"Sep 29, 2021","Don't worry about the blood, folks! It's just internal bleeding, and internal is where the blood is supposed to be anyway."
67,"Sep 29, 2021",the art is just *chef's kiss*
67,"Sep 29, 2021",even the constellations wants to see the Dokja's story!! and now he has a FABLE! A Kingless World ✨
67,"Sep 29, 2021","im a novel reader but i think yall too pressed about mistranslations.. unless it really disrupts the plot/understanding, its not much of a big deal?"
67,"Sep 29, 2021",err...why not just say king of a kingless world? it's easier and that's how they refer to it in the light novel.
67,"Sep 29, 2021","this is one of my favourite scenes in the novel, the moment when dokja made his first step towards the ""end"", the moment the concept of ""probability"" was first introduced, the moment dokja became ""King of the kingless world"", the moment everything started going downhill.... to all that are reading this for the first time, prepare yourselves. because not even the [Fourth wall] can save you from the hardships that's gonna come in the following arcs. ORV' true ""story"" starts here!"
67,"Sep 29, 2021","For those who are confused what is fable, think of legendary/mythical heros. They have their own story/fables becoming a heroic beings like Hercules going through 12 labors, Odysseus trojan horse, Sun Wukong starting a war against heavens. It is their achievements that show their strength and spread their reputation. In ORV, such stories are called fables and this fable system is very important, directly related to constellation/incarnation’s strength."
67,"Sep 29, 2021","Damn y'all being picky with the wording. Enjoy the story either way ya salty scrubs. Yo, Dokja is SUCH a BADDIE!! Literally the Constellations love him so much, or at least respect him so much, that they were willing to SHARE PAIN with a MERE HUMAN. Dokja truly is incredible."
67,"Sep 29, 2021",DOKJA IS SO PRETTY LOOK AT THAT LAST PANEL AHHHHH
67,"Sep 29, 2021",My man just weaves out a new storyline.
67,"Sep 29, 2021","Make your own path, blaze your own trail. Believe in yourself."
67,"Sep 29, 2021","This is by far the best webcomic on webtoon in my personal opinion, keep it up"
67,"Sep 29, 2021",The art in this chapter was amazing… author started out with great art style and it’s only gotten better and better with each episode. Wow! 
67,"Sep 29, 2021",this gave me chills. 
67,"Sep 29, 2021","This has been an amazing series thus far, but this chapter has pushed it into legendary territory. Bravo, author."
67,"Sep 29, 2021",the grip dokja has on my soul
67,"Sep 29, 2021",That was so fucking cool. 
67,"Sep 29, 2021",i got chills when the constellations helped dokja.. that was so cool! 
67,"Sep 29, 2021",Got goosebumps when the constellations started to share the burden of plausibility....
67,"Sep 29, 2021",this episode felt so cinematic i got shivers reading it 
67,"Sep 23, 2021","Wha... WHAT?!?! This is just too much, I can't even find the words to say how much I love this story, it just blows my mind EVERY👏 SINGLE👏 CHAPTER👏 and I'm living for it. Omniscent Reader is just amazing."
67,"Sep 13, 2021",The Naval warefare god is a real one for being the first to share the burden. The Bald army general probably helped as a way to pay dokja cause he dosen’t have many coins
67,"Aug 30, 2021",omg 😭😭😭😭 this was so beautiful. 
67,"Aug 28, 2021","My man really knows what's what, this is what makes him an awesome character"
67,"Aug 26, 2021","I'm loking at you, Dokja ❤"
67,"Aug 26, 2021","i hoped they kept the title ""king of the kingless world"" from the novel for me it sounds better. Also, at the end the title panel should've been kinda smudged or wobbly coz the artist intended for it to be that way, to give it a crumpled/sad/lonely effect. To add with the feeling of the rain and Dokja's condition at the end. The artist gave a good adaptation so i just think it's good to honor their efforts, now it just seem like some of it's wasted."
67,"Aug 25, 2021","I hope this isn’t ending any time soon, I feel like it’s only really started."
67,"Aug 25, 2021","It's been quite some time since I was so impacted by a story... A New Fable, Dokja's story to tell... Thanks Author, Artists and all collaborators for this amazing tale!!!"
67,"Oct 1, 2021",The fucking GOAT 
67,"Sep 29, 2021","i miss our initial broadcaster, this one is so buthurt and angry all the time"
67,"Sep 29, 2021"," He really is such an amazing character. The Gods respect him, he beat the strongest man, he defied the rulers of scenarios, he broke the system into rewarding him with a non existent achievement, he, a mere human, became the highest rank of constellations, and most importantly, he created the ending he wanted and became The King of a World Without a King."
67,"Aug 25, 2021",Talk about a hard-core stargazer….
67,"Mar 24, 2022","When the constellations started to share his burden you can just tell that they aren’t just in it to be entertained anymore, they really want Dokja to survive because they can’t comprehend him"
67,"Mar 20, 2022",that was quite the cinematic experience
67,"Jan 15, 2022","Dokja, you majestic b*stard 😭 "
67,"Jan 5, 2022","""a mysterious ruler has noticed a sudden chance in this world"" shouldn't that be ""change"", not ""chance""?"
67,"Dec 24, 2021","I've completed the novel but seriously I'm so emotional to see him create his first fable. 😭😭 King of a kingless world, his first big achievement. "
67,"Dec 19, 2021","Man, I straight up got chills, while I'm loving every single episode this one just hit me different. Why can't I live more than one like? 😭 "
67,"Dec 17, 2021",this episode brought the thrills and the feels.....
67,"Dec 10, 2021","Quite an astonishing moment, I would not lie. Beautiful "
67,"Dec 10, 2021",I'm just gonna leave this comment here so I can come back and remember this chapter.
67,"Dec 5, 2021","This chapter made me emotional. They shared the burden T_T even though constellations are beings who treat human life like worms, this was very humane for them. 😢 "
67,"Nov 16, 2021",okay but who's still amazed by everything??ITS ALL SO GOOD AND PRETTY AND SPECTACULAR-
67,"Nov 14, 2021",these last four chapters are what made me the fan of this series
67,"Nov 13, 2021",SO BEAUTIFUL
67,"Nov 12, 2021",woah.....
67,"Nov 11, 2021",Okay but hear me out. What if Dokja is the author of TWSA but he doesn’t know yet?
67,"Nov 11, 2021","Dokja might not be the protagonist of TWSA, but he sure is worthy to be the protagonist of this web comic. Super epic episode omg "
67,"Nov 5, 2021",Ah it brought me to tears how the constellations helped him 💛💛💛💛💛🥲🥲🥲🥲🥲🥲
67,"Nov 4, 2021",the writing is top tier dear lord
67,"Nov 3, 2021","I got so many shivers from this- dang. this was honestly amazing to read, I feel almost a part of it lol"
67,"Oct 24, 2021",This is so beautiful 😍
67,"Oct 22, 2021","dude this would be so epic if it was animated!!! king of a kingless world, kim dokja 👏👏"
67,"Oct 20, 2021","I'm speechless.....Dokja sacrifice... the constellations helping him.... just a beautiful, lovely chapter...."
67,"Oct 13, 2021",I remember when dokja was just s guy in the office who loved reading that book
67,"Oct 13, 2021","DOKJAAAA!♡ THIS CHAPTER IS INCREDIBLY BEAUTIFUL, I'M ABOUT TO CRY AGAIN WITH SO MUCH HAPPINESS WITHIN ME(>""♡""<)
THE FEELS BRO. THE FEELS!♡"
67,"Oct 10, 2021","I was really trying to ignore the silly translation but thats it...........WTF IS 'THE KING OF THE WORLD WITHOUT A KING' IF YOU DON'T CHANGE IT RIGHT NOW IMMA SLAP SOMEONE WITH YJH
gimme my 'King Of A Kingless World' back like 😭😭😭😭"
67,"Oct 8, 2021","i'm amazed at this fanbase, people have a good eye for mistakes in the translation. AND I'M AMAZED AT THE END OF THIS EPISODE SKDHDLFJKD DOKJA WHAT ON EARTH JUST HAPPENED"
67,"Oct 8, 2021",I honestly would love it more if they translated it to King of a Kingless World cause that would be more memorable. 
67,"Oct 7, 2021","Ok but the fact that Dokja is the definition of ""Good evening,God has let me live another day and im making it EVERYBODY'S problem"
67,"Oct 7, 2021",Now that’s a fable I can enjoy “A king in a World without a King”. Catchy let’s see where this King can go on his grand crusade!
67,"Oct 6, 2021","I was gonna read the next chapter, but I just had to re-read this one, and the chills remain intact aldjaldjsjdjd"
67,"Oct 6, 2021","ah yes ""king of a kingless world"" the most powerful fable to have ever existed"
67,"Oct 5, 2021","Dark Dimension? Nah, it sounded cooler when it referred to them as Eldritch. Ooh, the first probability storm! Truthfully, Dokja is probably the only one other than Junghyuk or Sooyung who could even survive it right now. And the first Fable… now this was the moment things changed. "
67,"Oct 5, 2021",Holy shit that's-I...uh- it's amazing!
67,"Oct 4, 2021",i am so in love with this story.
67,"Oct 3, 2021",Woahhhhh. I am left speechless. This was beautiful.
67,"Oct 2, 2021",woohooooo.dokjaaa soooo coool
67,"Oct 2, 2021","""WE'LL USE THE POWER OF FRIENDSHIP"" "
67,"Oct 2, 2021",The Constellations all jumping in there at the end to protect our boy was just so beautiful. 
67,"Oct 2, 2021",That was the most incredible chapter I've ever read. This story is VERY interesting. I can't wait to see how the story unfolds.
67,"Oct 1, 2021",THAT WAS DOPE
67,"Oct 1, 2021",So what’s his story he wanted to tell?
67,"Oct 1, 2021",holy hell I have goose bumps this episode was so insane new fable baby!
67,"Oct 1, 2021",Those constellations are homies for sharing the probability.
67,"Sep 30, 2021",wow i finally catched up 😍😳
67,"Sep 30, 2021",Doesn’t this mean Dokja is himself a constellation now? Or has the potential to become one?
67,"Sep 30, 2021","Wow...I love this comic in general for it's world building, art, and story - but this is the first time Dokja has seemed so heroic vs. pragmatic, as he was willing to risk death for the slight chance the world could be saved. And the stars setting sail *chills!*"
67,"Sep 30, 2021",I don't really understand what just happened but Dokja is like a legend now right🤩
67,"Sep 30, 2021",That was amazing!! Feels like a new arc will begin soon...it's going get even more epic isn't it
67,"Sep 30, 2021","if yall think this is good, just you wait. it gets even better "
67,"Sep 30, 2021",This was full and completely serious Dokja. Shit actually got real. I'm stunned by this episode. 
67,"Sep 30, 2021","What a chapter 😭😭😭 the birth of a fable (I'm kinda sad they stick to fables when they already used stories before but OK) ahhhh I'm crying, I love this so much"
67,"Sep 30, 2021","Dokja: ""YOU ACTIVATED MY TRAP CARD!"""
67,"Sep 30, 2021",BALD ARMY GENERAL IM SRRYWKSKDJJD
67,"Sep 30, 2021",LETS GO KING!!
67,"Sep 30, 2021",Dokja became a legend in his own right this chapter! The artwork was dope as always 🔥👍
67,"Sep 30, 2021",Wow I really love this webtoon! Dokja being the King of the Kingless and what he did is really cool! I can't wait to see how else he will surprise me in the future! 
67,"Sep 30, 2021",my fav manwha of all time
67,"Sep 30, 2021",THE LIMBS I WOULD SELL JUST TO WATCH THIS ANIMATED
67,"Sep 30, 2021",The constellations could have benefited from their incarnations getting the Fable. But they still chose to share Dokja's pain because they support what he did 😭
67,"Sep 30, 2021",NOW THIS IS THE KIND OF WEBTOON THAT DESERVES TO BECOME A MOVIE OR A SERIES.....
67,"Sep 29, 2021",King of a Kingless World sounds way more badass ngl.
67,"Sep 29, 2021",Goosebumps and sadness when Dokja said he only has one shot at his ending 
67,"Sep 29, 2021","THIS IS SO GOOD!!!! MY FAVORITE STORY EVER!! I’m in love with every single one of these characters, my heart and mind is racing. This is what I want to do. I’m in love with everything about this. Thank you"
67,"Sep 29, 2021",wow… this story never ceases to amaze me
67,"Sep 29, 2021",i got teary-eyed when the constellations shared the burden. and mooooore teary-eyed when dokja achieved something unfathomable. i felt so proud.
67,"Sep 29, 2021",favorite story on webtoon rn 🛐
67,"Sep 29, 2021","This chapter was amazing, I usually never leave comments on webtoon, but this will be my first since 2 years of using webtoon. This was amazing, it left a great impact, and I believe the story is progressing beautifully."
67,"Sep 29, 2021",This was a BOMB chapter 👌🏾👌🏾👌🏾
67,"Sep 29, 2021",Dokja be snatching constellations left and right 
67,"Sep 29, 2021",A king indeed. Danm. The constellations certainly have a favorite. XD
67,"Sep 29, 2021",THIS. IS. A. MASTERPIECE.
67,"Sep 29, 2021","Y'all. I couldn't wait for the updates so I read the translated comic online. When I caught up to that, I read the entire web novel. it took me two weeks, filled with endless laughter and tears. It's long, but written the way you'd read a webtoon. I highly suggest fans read the novel to get your fix!"
67,"Sep 29, 2021",PLEASE FOR THE LOVE OF GOD SOMEONE ANIMATE THIS SERIES 
67,"Sep 29, 2021",King of a kingless word sounds much better. A world without king? Cheesy af
67,"Sep 29, 2021",please change it to king of the kingless world.. it sounds much cooler and thats how it is in novel. plus ruler of dark dimension= outer god (make it this way it will make sense in future)
67,"Sep 29, 2021",one of the memorable chapters
67,"Sep 29, 2021",Yellow box? I assume this means it is a higher ruling authority than the system used to create the blue boxes.
67,"Sep 29, 2021",Remember when this was just killing bugs? I've been here since episode one and damn things change so quick
67,"Sep 29, 2021",This chapter was amazing!*^*
67,"Sep 29, 2021",Time to go get some free coins I can’t handle this cliffhanger..
67,"Sep 29, 2021",The fact that Dokja got basically all the constellations on his side and created a new fable is really something. It really shows you don’t need a sponsor to win the favour of the constellations!
67,"Sep 29, 2021","the constellations are actually seeming to be pretty good now, huh. I NEED MORRRRE"
67,"Sep 29, 2021","i needed a moment for that to sink in, i was just sitting, staring unblinkingly at my screen, not even reading the top comments that i had just scrolled to. applause for the author, i was literally speechless"
67,"Sep 29, 2021",Thank god the constellations intervened.. My respect for them increased...
67,"Sep 29, 2021",I very much enjoyed this
67,"Sep 29, 2021","""King of the world without a king"" oof. King of a Kingless world sounded better. Either way some dope shit coming up"
67,"Sep 29, 2021","The 'King of the world without a king'... I still prefer the 'King of a Kingless World'. I hope they don't change the names like what happened in the translation in the novel in between cause it's going to be a mess. And the Outer Gods too... Sigh. Anyways, but still, I LOVE THIS SCENE! Yes it's the beginning! It's starting!!! Though I'm 8 chapters ahead in the Manhwa. Still I support. Lezzgo! "
67,"Sep 29, 2021",‘A mysterious ruler sees his chance in this world’ …now whos this?
67,"Sep 29, 2021","Every chapter of this Webtoon is a gem. This chapter gave me literal chills. The fact that the constellations heard his wish for how he wanted to change the story and rewrite it, they're invested and they are looking out for him. That's such a big feat. To have the constellations following your story. Man, dokja and his gang really came through. "
67,"Sep 29, 2021",Yall what just happened?????????
67,"Sep 29, 2021",I want to read the original TWSA just to compare it to this cause I feel like the significance about some of this stuff is downplayed by our lack of knowledge of how things should be going in the original TWSA and how the world works
67,"Sep 29, 2021",meaning the story in the first world should have ended when he takes the throne? so dokja managed to not end the story in the first world therefore no regression therefore part 2 ? 
67,"Sep 29, 2021","I was astonished, enthralled,happy, scared, bewildered,Proud  throughout the chapter!!! A total package!!!... Kim Dokja,what a amazin character he is !!!!"
67,"Sep 29, 2021",AHHHH I WISH I HAVE MORE COINS I CANT WAIT😭
67,"Sep 29, 2021","dokja went to so many places, did so many things but at the end is still wearing a jacket... give my mam some clothes please 😂"
67,"Sep 29, 2021","The plot is amazing, the characters are amazing, the art is amazing, just everything about this Webtoon is absolutely amazing‼️😩"
67,"Sep 29, 2021",what a great name King of the world without a kingI was waiting for it from novel
67,"Sep 29, 2021",Wow...this actually made me speechless for a bit. (Even with some mistranslations)
67,"Sep 29, 2021","even with a bit of the mistranslations, this chapter WAS SO GOOD!!! "
67,"Sep 29, 2021",yall are complaining about translations and stuff but it's still a dope ass novel just enjoy it
67,"Sep 29, 2021","just remembered, where has Gilyeong been this whole time?"
67,"Sep 29, 2021",it's just sooooooo cool!!! the power of storytelling !!! saving a story and having the viewer save you!!! a story gains its power from what its readers want!! the levels . the layers . ough
67,"Sep 29, 2021","Damn, Dokja really willing to die for this. "
67,"Sep 29, 2021",T- T can't help but love these constellations for supporting Dokja.. got bit teary there. Can't wait to see what's next o-o
67,"Sep 29, 2021",This episode is gorgeous!! The art the story!!! Just wow!!!
67,"Sep 29, 2021","i do hope this gets an anime, cause the scene in this episode with all the constellations is BEAUTIFUL."
67,"Sep 29, 2021","Oohh, did y’all notice that the title got rain drop stains?? "
67,"Sep 29, 2021","Please listen to the people who say that King of a Kingless World is better, because King of a world without a king is quite possibly the worst thing to say and read in the history of reading and writing."
67,"Sep 24, 2021",my heart stopped for a moment. I thought this was the end. 😟😭🥺
67,"Sep 24, 2021","It looks impressive to me that Dokja was willing to die (or at least suffer a tremendous pain) just for the sake of ""saving"" the world. "
67,"Sep 23, 2021","That is.. Just awesome. I am so grateful to the author for giving us such a beautiful, funny, epic and tragic story. It has been a long time since I haven't loved a fiction that intensely. Thank you so much. I can't wait to see what is in store outside Seoul now. "
67,"Sep 22, 2021",Favorite episode so far in Omniscient Reader

67,"Sep 30, 2021","As a reader of the web novel, this chapter (and the whole series) was pure gold. I wish they went with outer gods instead of rulers of the dark dimension though in their translation though"
67,"Sep 30, 2021","Easily one of the best, if not the best, chapter so far. "
67,"Sep 30, 2021",This chapter was epic 😭😭😭
67,"Sep 30, 2021",This just rose up to my top three fave webtoons quicker than Dokja can think
67,"Sep 30, 2021",goosebumps fucking goosebumps this arc is AWESOME!
67,"Sep 30, 2021",Thank you constellations. Thank you.
67,"Sep 30, 2021",King of a Kingless World is where it's at. I'm surprised many comments are saying the same l
67,"Sep 30, 2021",YOU HAVE NO IDEA HOW BUMPY MY SKIN FEELS RN IM HAVING GOOSEBUMPS FOR THE PAST 3 MINUTES
67,"Sep 30, 2021",this chapter is fantastic god I love this so much
67,"Sep 30, 2021",[The constelation daughter of a broken dream is looking forward the next chapter. 5 coins have been gifted]

67,"Sep 30, 2021",Literally got chills this chapter. Can’t wait to see where the series will go!
67,"Sep 30, 2021",I bow my head in respect
67,"Sep 30, 2021",Damn Dokja back at your suicidal tendencies I see
67,"Sep 30, 2021",Amazing ep!!!! dokja is amazing!!!
67,"Sep 30, 2021",That was so epic! What a great payoff of all these separate interactions coming together!
67,"Sep 30, 2021",loved this chapter! 
67,"Sep 30, 2021",This scene hit me in the feels so hard!  Let see what story this new fable will make. King of the World Without a King.
67,"Sep 30, 2021",love that last visual! 
67,"Sep 30, 2021",This is literally taking your destiny by the hand 
67,"Sep 30, 2021",bro some of these comments forget that this isn't their webtoon story to make 💀
67,"Sep 30, 2021","Waaaaoooo this was unexpected... Him turning into a fable, possible a constellation (if I'm not wrong) what an awesome success! Kxnskfnwkdbws"
67,"Sep 30, 2021",The last page was so beautiful.. Its sad how dokja took so much burden but amaizing how so many constellations started to support him from far away
67,"Sep 30, 2021","Is Dokja going to become a Constellation, specifically the Constellation King of a Kingless World??"
67,"Sep 29, 2021","One of the best episodes, so far"
67,"Sep 29, 2021",this is the best webtoon ive ever read
67,"Sep 29, 2021","I much prefer ""Star Relic"" over Constellation Artifact. The later may be accurate but the former just rolls off the tongue better. Considering what they use to fight in this story, I think it's better to condense what you can. Future fight scenes are going to be quite a mouthful as is which is why I also agree with the top comments. "
67,"Sep 29, 2021",i can't even begin to say how much feelings this comic gives me?? this is illegal. 
67,"Sep 29, 2021",Why not just keep using King of a Kingless World?? It sounds a lot better
67,"Sep 29, 2021",I want to see it animated !!!
67,"Sep 29, 2021",i-is this what has become of the comments section now? disputing translations...
67,"Sep 29, 2021",i smell a end of season cliff hanger coming soon
67,"Sep 29, 2021","The Fable, The King of the world without a king, is one of my favorite story."
67,"Sep 29, 2021",What a great chapter. This webtoon never fails to amaze me.
67,"Sep 29, 2021",dude just turned into a god without expecting.
67,"Sep 29, 2021",Soo did he became a constellation ?  Will he be his own sponsor ?
67,"Sep 29, 2021",I like how the title is smudged by raindrops! A small but nice feature to match the scenery!
67,"Sep 29, 2021",this chapter unironically gave me chills… wow. 
67,"Sep 29, 2021",AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
67,"Sep 29, 2021","Dokja sweetie, you really are a king aren't you boy? It was so heartwarming when all the constellations started helping Dokja ❤️ "
67,"Sep 29, 2021","just amazing, nice plot twist there :D"
67,"Sep 29, 2021","this is just too good, very good for my heart 😂"
67,"Sep 29, 2021",and here starts dokja's endless self-sacrificing nature that will piss junhyeok off-
67,"Sep 29, 2021",ughh i just got goosebumps. didn't think it would be possible with a webtoon ADFHJ
67,"Sep 29, 2021",Ngl this has been my favorite chapter so far

67,"Sep 29, 2021",the goosebumps everytime 😫
67,"Sep 29, 2021",I got literal chills when the constellations all teamed up to share the burden.
67,"Sep 29, 2021",dayummm Dokja 😩😭 i’m obsessedddd omygoshhh
67,"Sep 29, 2021","ladies and gentlemen, he's broken the game!"
67,"Sep 29, 2021",The constellations are rooting for him
67,"Sep 29, 2021",Wow..im speechless
67,"Sep 29, 2021","Wow, this was epic. Well done, very well made."
67,"Sep 29, 2021",Can we all agree that Dokja is a boss?
67,"Sep 29, 2021",Here comes the Kingless World
67,"Sep 29, 2021",did dokja become a fabled constellation??
67,"Sep 29, 2021",this story is just the best its my favorite everything is unpredictable you did well author ❤❤❤
67,"Sep 29, 2021",could someone explain plausibility please? me no get it 🤷
67,"Sep 29, 2021","This series just jumped from a high 8 to a high 9 or solid 10, which means imma reread the shit out of this"
67,"Sep 29, 2021",I liked the dokabei before this one he's not even cute.
67,"Sep 29, 2021",goosebumps all over the place in this chapter
67,"Sep 29, 2021",i loved every part of this whole chapter. woooooow just wow
67,"Sep 29, 2021","I dont understand , what is a fable?"
67,"Sep 29, 2021",Damn this is so good (╥﹏╥) I can't wait for the 5th scenario it will surely flood~ with comments ヽ(´ー`)人(´∇｀)人(`Д´)ノ
67,"Sep 29, 2021","Goosebumps on that last scene, this is super good "
67,"Sep 29, 2021",This chapter is just *chef kiss*
67,"Sep 29, 2021",Holy sh***t that was amazing!!!
67,"Sep 29, 2021",wait.... did he become a constellation!? but he should be a mythical not fabeled (or whatever the most powerful one is!!!!!) he deserves to be at the top.. I hope he can make his way up still
67,"Sep 29, 2021",YEAH DOKJAAAAAA UR SO BADASSSSSSSS WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOHOOOOOOOOOOOOO
67,"Sep 29, 2021",king of a kingless world is such a better title. its the original translation from the novel
67,"Sep 29, 2021","The translation feels so bad, It is in consistent, there is complete lack of flow, every name feels clunky and forced, i starting to think that some trash translator company was hired to translate this webtoon, it is has level of some intern who is non native english speaker which finished his education in middle school. "
67,"Sep 29, 2021",NO!! they changed it from “King of a Kingless World” TT
67,"Sep 29, 2021",man it's annoying how many mistakes are made in these translations 
67,"Sep 29, 2021",Holy craaaaap it just gets better and better!! Good job to all the people working on this masterpeice!! WOOOOO
67,"Sep 29, 2021",This story is so wonderfully done. Dokja has gone from being a reader who never chose to be anything more to someone willing to give everything up to tell the story he wants told. Beautiful writing.
67,"Sep 29, 2021",dokja look thicc in the last panel 😲😉
67,"Sep 29, 2021","Honestly I'm at my wits end with Webtoon translators. It's getting progressively worse. As a novel reader I cringe at many of the choices they've  made. Ruler of the dark dimension? No it's Outer God. King of the World without a King""- FFS NO King of a Kingless World."
67,"Sep 29, 2021","goosebumps, seeing this scene drawn was amazing😳"
67,"Sep 29, 2021",I want to read novel BUT it's way TOO long and I have VERY short patience 😭
67,"Sep 29, 2021",KING OF A WORLD WITHOUT A KING LETS GOOOOOO
67,"Sep 29, 2021","King of a Kingless World sounds much better tbh, kinda wish whoever was translating this took some liberties. Sure, what was said was accurate, but it certainly does not roll off the tongue.Either way, pog! Fable 1 acquired!"
67,"Sep 29, 2021",Dojka managed to exceed my expectations once again 🙂 and the constellations helping him almost made me tear up tbh
67,"Sep 29, 2021",D-Dormamu?
67,"Sep 29, 2021",This had me in tears.It was so breathtaking. And How is anyone even going to survive through the scenario if they haven't read .This is basically made so that no one survives right ? 
67,"Sep 29, 2021","Somehow, seeing the boxes turn gold (because yellow doesn’t sound as god) looks so satisfying!!! ⭐️"
67,"Sep 29, 2021",They are looking at you 👁️👁️
67,"Sep 23, 2021",Ah... the Stars have Alligned... or have they?!?
67,"Sep 22, 2021",Me: this WEBTOON has over 60 episodes should keep me busy a while.Me two days later: time to start spending some coins
67,"Sep 22, 2021",Not regretting spending 5 coins on this chapter. 😭👏
67,"Sep 22, 2021",I’m glad I spent my hard earned 5 coins ✨
67,"Sep 21, 2021","that's some ""END OF SEASON ONE"" shit right there wtf 🤯"
67,"Sep 15, 2021","This whole comic has just escalated in such a fantastic way. When I started reading I would have never imagined the journey this story would take me on would be so amazing. At this point I have no idea what will happen next, but I'm excited to find  out."
67,"Sep 3, 2021",bro that was the best chapter yet omfg 👏👏👏
67,"Aug 27, 2021","Yo,  this is SO F'ING GOOD "
67,"Aug 27, 2021",I don't think this episode is worthy of 5 coin like this ep is so heart warming and emotional
67,"Aug 27, 2021","I love this comic sooo much.... the extremely pissed off look of the White furry two horned gremlins face when Dojka was pretty much saying ""f*ck off I do what I want"" was funny as HELL... but... someone please take the time to read this and answer my few questions that I got cuz I didn't understand why the White furry gremlin was mad as HELL about the throne situation.... and I have a few questions to ask y'all. so please go and look at the questions in the replies sections some one please help"
67,"Aug 27, 2021",It’s so good!
67,"Aug 26, 2021",This is right up there with my favorite episode- episode 40. I have absolutely no regrets spending coins on this Webtoon. Damn it is so good.
67,"Aug 26, 2021",this webtoon is the reason i’m broke and honestly? i don’t regret a thing
67,"Aug 26, 2021",Take all of the coins I have!!! I’m reading this like a movie and imagining it as such. Goosebumps at the end of this episode can’t wait for the next one!
67,"Aug 26, 2021",i'm so happy I put coins into this
67,"Aug 26, 2021",I love this comic so much
67,"Aug 26, 2021",the story keeps getting better and thrilling thank you!
67,"Aug 26, 2021","I love this part so much, but the name [King of a Kingless World] >>>>>>"
67,"Aug 25, 2021","Gosh that was so amazing!! I, too, would like to see the end that Kim Dokja wants ☺️"
67,"Aug 25, 2021",Wait are we seeing what I think we are seeing? “A new fable has been created” and the name “the king of a world without kings” does this mean Dokja is becoming a constellation himself or am I reading too much into this?
67,"Aug 25, 2021",THAT WAS EPIC
67,"Aug 25, 2021","wow. I'm in awe 😳 I'm really curious how redice would interpret this chapter into drawing format, and initially I thought they will do it in grand, amazing, and 'wow' art like in other manhwas when the MC achieve something big. but they use 'emotional approach' instead, and while it can be a lil bit underwhelming, for me it just fits well in this chapter context, especially when you already know what this chapter really is about and its implications; it made this chapter 999 times more sadder"
67,"Aug 25, 2021",I fast passed all the way here and I don't regret it one bit. when the constellations shared burden of plausibility with dokja I almost shed a tear. 
67,"Aug 25, 2021",that was so goood!!!! I can't wait to see see the art with the story. it's such a good story and just keeps getting better!
67,"Aug 25, 2021","This episode was awesome, truly deserving the name of a fable"
67,"Aug 25, 2021",The last two chapters gave me chills. Absolutely stunning.
67,"Aug 25, 2021",I am in awe. This is such a fantastic story. I can't wait for the rest 😍
67,"Aug 25, 2021",This episode was amazing. I got chills
67,"Aug 25, 2021",I have school in like 5 hours & spent probably 30 coins. I have no regrets but I'd have to wait longer for new chapters 
67,"Aug 25, 2021",YESS IT IS YOUR STORY!!!!! LET THEM KNOW DOKJA 
67,"Aug 25, 2021",literally got chills when reading a 'new fable' was created. been such a long time since a story could get such a reaction from me. well done author and artist (and translater) 
67,"Aug 25, 2021","I'm obessed with this! I love it ! Everything in this chapter was priceless and utterly awesome, long live to the King of the kingless world !! ✨✨✨"
67,"Aug 25, 2021","Wow... our eyes are on you too, Dokja. Share with us the story you so desperately wish to tell."
67,"Aug 25, 2021",SO FUCKING BADASS!!!!!!

67,"Aug 25, 2021","he almost got me in the first half, not gonna lie. i really thought dokja was gonna die for a second there... the constellations are so nice "
67,"Aug 25, 2021",I'm on the edge of my seat like holy cow 😭😭Why is this not a anime already 
67,"Sep 29, 2021",I'm really tired of the top comments being people complaining about the translation.

67,"Aug 25, 2021","my mans really said, if you can’t beat them join them and became a fable"
67,"Aug 25, 2021",Was it just me or this was a REALLY GOOD chapter?

67,"Sep 30, 2021",Okay that episode...was DOPE
67,"Sep 30, 2021",I can’t believe the Four Yin Demon Decapitator became an Constellation Artifact. This episode has such an amazing translation.
67,"Sep 30, 2021",This gave me freaking shivers man 😖❤️ so Dokja became a fable and therefore sort of like a constellation??  
67,"Sep 30, 2021","by the way i thught taht the other country had a throne too? why this make it sound like it is only in korea.edit: to answer, yes i know that, but if the other have a throne too what's the use of removing one, the outer god, will still be connected to the planet, i red the book too but i never got that part"
67,"Sep 30, 2021",I don’t get why the final panel is upside down tho.

67,"Sep 29, 2021",Everything that he's doing. Everything he believes and fights for. I think Dokja will become a Constellation in his own right. This is amazing beyond words!

67,"Sep 29, 2021","Give me shivers, man! "
67,"Sep 29, 2021",we know who is the constellation's favorite😁
67,"Sep 29, 2021",idky but i got a bit emo here. he must have been really passionate about this story when he was reading it. he really changed it to how he would have wanted it. 
67,"Sep 29, 2021","Dokja created a new Fable, does this mean that he now transcends higher than a normal humans with lower constellations? Well maybe I'm wrong cause being an origin of a fable doesn't make one it's main protagonist.But we all know that he's the main protagonist of this story anyway so~"
67,"Sep 29, 2021",No words. Just... Wow
67,"Sep 29, 2021",You'd think this would be part of a finale but there's still more 
67,"Sep 29, 2021",Swag
67,"Sep 29, 2021",Daaaamn i got goosebumps
67,"Sep 29, 2021",now that was a solid conclusion

Dokja IS the newest Constellation and a FABLE at that too, I wonder what his powers will be too"

67,"Sep 29, 2021",the last panel was fabulous but i also loved that the title looked like some rain drops had fallen on it
67,"Sep 29, 2021",OMG! WHAT A GREAT CHAPTER!!!

67,"Sep 29, 2021","""King of the World without King"" is good but I still hope that they keep the original ""King of the Kingless World""."
67,"Sep 29, 2021",naw what is up with these translations bring back king of  a kingless world 😭😭 it sounds so much more epic
67,"Sep 29, 2021","Cam just talk about how Dokja now has two constellation class weapon with the new one(four yin demon decapitated) being able to serve the link between  a constellation, that’s just overpower and now Dokja has it I hope others survive is all I’m saying"
67,"Sep 29, 2021","After reading this chapter, I remember a certain quote in the back of my mind. Dokja destroying the throne and Constellations watching has made him leave a strong legacy in changing everything. Their world, their fate, and their future. It is this quote that became the representation of what Dokja stand for so that people will not lose hope in their darkest hour. This is Dokja’s legacy. “This is where your story begins.”"
67,"Sep 29, 2021","Will Dokja end up becoming a constellation himself? The constellations gave him a title, and even a fable about Dokja was created... it seems he might atleast achieve something similar to a constellation's level of power even if he doesn't become a constellation."
67,"Sep 29, 2021",That was fantastic great job!
67,"Sep 29, 2021",WTF?.... why am i crying while the constelations look ay dokja?... screw this... i love this story

67,"Sep 29, 2021","Huh, none of the usual constellations were helping(Uriel, Son Wu Kong, ect.)"
67,"Sep 29, 2021",You beautiful bitch.

67,"Sep 29, 2021",I... I almost thought Dokja will become a constellation...
67,"Sep 29, 2021",Y’know that Kim Dokja will always take the hard routes. Easy ain’t always the best ^^
67,"Sep 29, 2021","Damn, it felt legendarily cool and satisfying!!"
67,"Sep 29, 2021","No Dokja is not a constellation now. Incarnations can achieve fables, from my understanding with enough fables achieved and certain conditions met, an incarnation can become a constellation, maybe."
67,"Sep 29, 2021","wait , I think the constellations who were giving him coins did not join in .😣"
67,"Sep 29, 2021","i really like the details, such as the end title being covered in raindrops on the paper it is written on."

67,"Jan 26, 2022","this is why i feel in love with this webtoon. I read the LN because the webtoon only had 10 chapters at the time, and this is one of, if not the best chapters with this series. theres a few more noticable chapters as well, but this really was the best for me. i'm so glad webtoon has done the novel justice."
67,"Jan 25, 2022",he sure looks more like a protagonist than the protagonist himself 
67,"Jan 24, 2022",this mf still think he's not a main character? someone needs to fix his self eestem bc though it doesn't seem fucked up how can a guy be so blind about his own awesomeness
67,"Jan 24, 2022",Can't believe that I just cried because of how epic that was...

67,"Jan 18, 2022",I like how the title has become stained with rain. Authors who use their own logo to great advantage are usually the most creative.
67,"Jan 13, 2022",wow...this story is amazing
67,"Jan 10, 2022",The word plausibility has come up multiple times and I’ve searched up the meaning but I still don’t get it in the context of the story someone plz explain it to me

67,"Dec 8, 2021","*sub scenario ends* ""h-has it ended?"""
67,"Dec 7, 2021","wow, this story is beyond amazing. the way the constellations shared the burden with him, goosebumps. can't believe that this is only just the beginning and there's so much more to this story. i really need to catch up with the novel! dokja also looked so pretty in the last panel :<"
67,"Dec 5, 2021","god, the last panel made me speechless. Love how the author drew that expression on dokja's face"
67,"Dec 5, 2021","if dokja died, will he be a constellation"
67,"Nov 29, 2021",Okay can someone explain to me what plausibility is and what fables are in this story dhdjjdd

67,"Nov 6, 2021",damn i wouldve cried 
67,"Nov 4, 2021","can someone explain to me ""plausibility"" and what dokja meant by that he tried his best to make things seem probable?"
67,"Nov 3, 2021",Well everything is fine but my instincts say that blondish girl from Dokja's office(Sangah) is dangerous or is hiding something. 
67,"Oct 30, 2021","""King of the world without a king"" yup, that's Dokja alright"
67,"Oct 30, 2021","so......if he started a new fable, doesn't that mean after he dies he could become a constellation?"
67,"Oct 28, 2021",Tis nothing but a scratch
67,"Oct 26, 2021",this will be my favorite chapter 
67,"Oct 23, 2021","tbh I like ""King of a World without a King"" over the other translation, better symmetry."
67,"Oct 23, 2021",It's so beautiful
67,"Oct 22, 2021",The constellation are simps of Dokja :D

67,"Oct 3, 2021","It's lit 👌, still waiting for 68 But I think that the author wrote TWSA so that Dokja would see how the world would be like without him or to warn him about the new world and to be there saviour."

67,"Sep 29, 2021",this story keeps getting better 😭❤️
67,"Sep 29, 2021","I like this story a lot, but I think it illustrates the concept in Eastern culture that I would call 'secret knowledge'.You know, like in many Japanese games you would profit a lot from knowing smth from guides outside of the game. Or if you're playing it a second time. And like that in this scenario there was nothing from which you could've come to conclusion that the throne is so dangerous. It was totally indeductible from prior knowledge. "
67,"Sep 29, 2021",I want to know what does the author usually mean by constellations? As sometimes even the stars are mentioned as a constellation like in this chapter.
67,"Sep 29, 2021","At this pint there’s on right for Junghyeok yu to be the hero of TWSA he always sleeping & find everything is ready!!, Dojka is working so hard! & I want to fight 🤺 any one saying he’s not hot!, he is so handsome! and cute sometimes!"

67,"Sep 29, 2021",dokkaebi principal thought he can fail Dokja in test. But fortunately he's indirectly sponsored by benefactors like constellations. Also [Lord of dark dimension Dormammu wishes not to mess with KDJ. ]

67,"Sep 29, 2021",This chapter was pretty much a grand movie ending. I love this comic. Can’t wait to read more :)
67,"Sep 29, 2021",omg i just noticed that this is barely chp 15???? isnt the novel like 500 😳 very tempted to read it 
67,"Sep 29, 2021",“Three Ways To Survive The Apocalypse” could this be one of the ways? Could the title actually indicate the web novel was meant to serve as a guide to actually ending the apocalypse? “Do these three specific but insanely hard tasks and the world will not end”
67,"Sep 29, 2021",This was one of the most satisfying episodes so far! it's like the ending- or not quite ending- of a movie when the good guys win. i thoroughly enjoyed it!
67,"Sep 29, 2021",Damn that last panel gave me goosebumps!

67,"Sep 29, 2021",Ohhh... This. Was. So. POWERFUL! 🔥🔥🔥🔥My emotions are a mess! 🤯 *internally screaming* 
67,"Sep 29, 2021","So since he’s a fable, that means in order for his story to be a legit, there can be no regressions bc everyone in the story is supposed to only live once to make it a whole and true story. Will he become a constellation then when he dies? "
67,"Sep 29, 2021","Damnit it seems it’s finally time for me read the LN, I need to understand what this means "
67,"Sep 29, 2021",Holy HELL that was EPIC!!! 
67,"Sep 29, 2021","The translation is killing me but I hope it gets to improve in later chapters, tho look at dokja at the last panel hes such a beautiful man"
67,"Sep 29, 2021",THAT WAS SO COOL WTH
67,"Sep 29, 2021",AAAAAAAAA KING SHIT

67,"Sep 29, 2021","I absolutely love how the main character has planned everything, and the payoff of just watching the main character carry out the plan is amazing! (Kudos to the people who made this you did amazing)"
67,"Sep 29, 2021","dude, sorry I'm so stupid but what do they mean by""the burden of plausibility "" could someone explain please "
67,"Sep 29, 2021",This was AWESOME 👏 👏  does this mean his story was becoming a fable? 😮

67,"Sep 29, 2021",HOLY FREAKING CRAP THIS CHAPTER
67,"Sep 29, 2021",10000000000/10 rating the was great 
67,"Sep 29, 2021",aaaa dokja finally got his first great fable!!!
67,"Sep 29, 2021",Ok but the water droplets on the name
67,"Sep 29, 2021","So the reason Dokja destroyed the throne is that if he sits on it, this world ends. So only the one who sat on it will go to the next regression and everyone else die (except Jung hyeok since he’s the main char of the world?)? Am i understanding this right? "
67,"Sep 29, 2021",Man that was insane
67,"Sep 29, 2021",I legit thought he was gonna die
67,"Sep 29, 2021","I just have one word for this whole serie ""WOW"" "
67,"Sep 29, 2021","Ong that was so cool can't wait for the next part and king of the world without a king is cool, I wonder how much coins he will get or how mad the cute thing will be"
67,"Sep 29, 2021",WHAT JUST HAPPENED!?!?
67,"Sep 29, 2021",did he just become a fabled constellation!??!
67,"Sep 29, 2021",Beautiful chapter! Very awesome. Super curious to see where the story goes now that this capture the flag/get the throne scenario seems to be ending.

67,"Sep 29, 2021","This is the second time i’ve cries reading this ep, is so good ㅠㅠ"
67,"Sep 29, 2021",And now the true story begins
67,"Sep 29, 2021","I'm calling it now. Dokja is a constellation, and the story he read was just his future self somehow."
67,"Sep 28, 2021",This gave me CHILLS. It was worth more than 5 coins that's for sure
67,"Sep 26, 2021",Y'all when I say I screamed- I literally screamed. THIS EP WAS THE BEST BY FAR!!
67,"Sep 23, 2021",So in case of something there's a chance dokja can be a constellation now that he's a fable. But ofc for him to succeed that can't happen. it's a little thought I had while reading.omg I'm so excited for what's coming!!! like this is setting more new boundaries!
67,"Sep 22, 2021","i am crying😭😵 this is mind blowing, i am stunned"
67,"Sep 22, 2021",I feel overwhelmed with the support that Dokja has recieved in the previous ep and this one too!!!!!!!!!!!

There is no suspension as we can hear item X having hidden function that solves a problem we just learned about. You could replace the sword with toothbrush and revelation would work the same way.

67,"Jul 27, 2022",""" king of the world without a king "" has a beautiful meaningin ancient time the king will be someone from the royal family, they have to have the connection with the king and for this scenario Dokja would be a king if he had the throne of a different king but he didn't want to get that which is tied with another king 
He wanted to tell that he will be someone who can fulfill the duty's of a King and also can gain the respect of other kings without the help of another king!!!!

67,"Apr 7, 2022",Ah so the world ends if you use the throne. No wonder you can't clear it. Sneaky Dokkaebi. Dokja's next move was pretty badass. So badass he earned the respect of the Constellations. It was so touching when they started helping him and eased his paint And that new fable being created 😬👌. Only Dokja could do the impossible and unexpected. 
67,"Apr 5, 2022",so did he become a constellation
67,"Apr 3, 2022",dokja is so darn pretty for what
67,"Apr 3, 2022",the fact that so much constellations were helping dokja awww
67,"Apr 2, 2022",this would literally break everything if it wud be made into an anime and executed WELL
67,"Apr 1, 2022","""KING OF THE WORLD WITHOUT A KING""wow this episode really left me so WOWOWOW "
67,"Apr 1, 2022",did Dokja just get his own constellation ?
67,"Mar 31, 2022",Dokja got a fat ass fo sore 👓🤌🏽👨🏾‍🦳
67,"Mar 30, 2022",Kim Donna looks so SEXY
67,"Mar 29, 2022",How could a new fable be created if he didn't have a constellation unless the part of the contract where it said he couldn't get a supporting constellation unless he died but he did technicality did die but got revived due to king of no killing
67,"Mar 28, 2022",That is so sick 
67,"Mar 26, 2022",HOLY SHI-

67,"Mar 18, 2022",Damn Dokja what a thick ass you have 👀
67,"Mar 14, 2022",This reminds me of the last scene from the 3rd kung fu panda movie where they all hold up their paw and give chi to Po to pull him out of the spirit realm lol
67,"Mar 13, 2022",HOLY FART NUGGET
67,"Mar 12, 2022",Wait... waitwaitwaitwait..... DID DOKJA JUST BECOME A CONSTALATION!?!??!?!!??!

67,"Mar 8, 2022",doesn't dokja just come back to life? I forgot the requirements.
67,"Mar 8, 2022","Does this mean my guy just turned himself into a constellation, or gave himself the power of one?"
67,"Mar 6, 2022",I'm actually crying

67,"Feb 3, 2022",Goosebumps. The beginning of next chapter!
67,"Feb 3, 2022","Would have been better if they use a better title like ""The Uncrowned King"" just my opinion though"
67,"Feb 3, 2022",That was so satisfying that I had to give a minute of silence and just think about it.

67,"Feb 1, 2022",YOOOOOOO
67,"Jan 31, 2022",The Constellations' sharing of his burden actually broke me.
67,"Jan 31, 2022",Day 66 of voicing all the characters
67,"Jan 30, 2022","aaaaand he's starting to make his own story, his own constellation (｡♡‿♡｡)(●♡∀♡)"
67,"Jan 30, 2022",I respect his character. Sometimes the protagonist who is said to be the protagonist need not be the one.
67,"Jan 29, 2022",Kim Dokja you're such a main character and I love you

67,"Jan 27, 2022","I wonder what would happen if Junyeok could also see Dokja‘s point of view everytime he gets beaten unconscious. Unlikely to happen, cause he doesn‘t has the matching skill, but still.. just wondering"
67,"Jan 26, 2022",I think I might start reading this Webtoon...I'll think about it though.

67,"Dec 5, 2021",WAIT... I DON'T UNDERSTAND😭 why would they create a new story? my brain is malfunctioning
67,"Dec 5, 2021","brava! what a beautifully written, succinct, wrap to this plot! well done, keep up the good work🖤"
67,"Dec 1, 2021",how did he know that? so does that mean that he would be the last person to die in this regression?
67,"Nov 30, 2021",Reading this chapter with God Shattering Star playing in the background was an awesome experience
67,"Nov 25, 2021",So proud of my man Dokja🤗
67,"Nov 25, 2021",that was amazing!!! 
67,"Nov 25, 2021",I don't understand the plausibility probability thing

67,"Oct 25, 2021","Ñ, estaba tan bueno el anterior que me pase este con diccionario en mano"

67,"Oct 6, 2021",hehehhe...until he does get regression and then he repeats it with ... The mc of twsa. (I just realized that I can't spell his name but I'm too lazy to go check it) ....I'm probably getting ahead of myself tho. 
67,"Oct 5, 2021",Dokjaaaa
67,"Oct 5, 2021",🌱
67,"Oct 4, 2021","How about if the fable would be called ""Uncrowned king of the world"" or ""Worlds' uncrowned king""? 🤔"
67,"Oct 4, 2021",Wait he said he won’t need a next regression maybe Sonja has lived three this in the form of how ever many regressions and he’s finally gotten this ending the ending he wanted and the outcome he wanted idk if this is possible but my brain had a light bulb moment

67,"Oct 1, 2021","If you are confused the translation is a bit shaky ""King of the world Without a king"" would basically mean ""Throneless king ?"" I don't know man it seems off to me but besides that? this chapter was heat"
67,"Oct 1, 2021",BRUHHH THE CHANGED TRANSLATIONS ERK ME SO NMUCHHDH
67,"Oct 1, 2021","That was beautiful! Seeing all the constellations he ever touched somehow, help him out... but did he, like, become a constellation? 'cause fables are the people behind the constellation, right? i'm not sure tho"

67,"Sep 29, 2021",d-did he just become a constellation?
67,"Sep 29, 2021","No truce with kings.
When the fable was created it actually got really dusty in here somehow."
67,"Sep 29, 2021",is this the power of a god?
67,"Sep 29, 2021",Single star=constellation? I don’t think that’s how that works. Edit: to clarify. I’m referring to the Big Dipper stars each being a “constellation.”
67,"Sep 29, 2021",Does anyone know if this series / source novel are available as published copies for purchase anywhere? Definitely want to add this masterpiece to my shelf
67,"Sep 29, 2021",What a superb chapter! That's an amazing story! Suprise us more writer-nim! ❤️💜 감사합니다!

67,"Sep 29, 2021",idk about anyone else but I got major chills from this chapter holy wowza!!!
67,"Sep 29, 2021",soooo.... Dokja became a Fabled constellation. that was his plan all along? or he just wanted to cut the tie between the outer gods and this world to give it a better ending than TWSA's?
67,"Sep 29, 2021","hmm I'd prefer it if they actually translated the names of each of the stars of the big dipper. Like the seven stars are actually called Alioth, Dubhe, Merak, Phecda, Megrez, Mizar, and Alkaid. But they also apparently have titles because they're dieties in korean folklore collectively called Chilseong"
67,"Sep 29, 2021",That was beautiful man ;')
67,"Sep 29, 2021",This episode was just simply so beautiful.
67,"Sep 29, 2021","Woooo The boy got his first Fable! 👏👏👏 This novel reader is excited to see the next chapters, the art is gorgeous, especially that last panel of Dokja ♡"

67,"Sep 29, 2021",Beautiful mc go!
67,"Sep 29, 2021","When the constellations were looking at him, one after another, I got chills. I'm loving everything about this webtoon so far"

67,"Aug 27, 2021",I thought it was originally a king of a throneless world. maybe I'm misremembering 
67,"Aug 27, 2021",I don’t know if it’s been explained already but I’m really confused on the plausibility and what it means and why it’s an issue and he got pain from it. If anyone can explain I’d really appreciate it. Like I don’t even understand what plausibility is I just remember a chapter said that he did too much and then he was getting a review by the dokkabea (forgive my spelling) or something but I still don’t get it. Thanks in advance!
