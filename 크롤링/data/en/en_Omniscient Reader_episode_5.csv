They deserve to read it for the first time spoiler free just as you did. Edit: Correction, the original story is a webnoval."

5,"Dec 15, 2020",Why don’t they just bruise or even brush someone else’s skin. I mean the cells in human bodies are living organisms and skin cells die all the time due to constant interaction with other things. They don’t need to kill a whole human being. Just some of their cells. You can even just shake hands with someone. 🤝 They won’t die but it does count as killing a and even many living organisms. Like use your brains 🙄🙄🙄🙄🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️ they don’t even need to kill a bug

5,"Jan 21, 2021","Usually in storylines like this where characters have to complete tasks or die they always find a way around it to not kill or hurt anyone, it was clear as day there and was not a brain thinker. “Kill a living organism” that could be a plant or a bug.

5,"Aug 28, 2020",can someone tell me why don t they kill the insects in the kid s cage?
5,"Aug 28, 2020",Just use hand sanitizer or something. Single-celled organisms like germs also count as living organisms too.
5,"Aug 28, 2020","(not a spoiler just a gander) I figured there’d be a fly or something and after everyone has killed each other dokja points at it telling her, “uve got 1 minute”😵😵"

5,"Aug 27, 2020",But there’s a reason WHY the author decided to gift Dokja with the webtoon tho? I feel like they saw smth in him and have been watching him this whole time and saw he was worthy? I men’s if this author is capable of bringing a story to life don’t you think they’d have the capability of secretly observing Dokja?

5,"Aug 27, 2020","Dumb question, it says kill any living organism..... can't that mean the bugs the kid has or trying to go after the demon thing ?"
5,"Aug 27, 2020","Since it says organism, couldn't you just slap your arm to kill some of the surface bacteria and be done with it?"
5,"Aug 27, 2020",The clean art style resembles a lot Solo Leveling.

5,"Aug 26, 2020",Dang white hair guy kinda hot tho
5,"Aug 26, 2020","I believe they failed the test.There were 2 routes:kill people or kill the grasshoppers that keep showing up w/ the little boy.Almost everyone else except Dokja,Sanga,&the lieutenant chose to kill a person.Also,how would it feel to find out the protagonist of the story you read was in the bloody cabin behind you?😧I wonder what the protagonist of TWSA & the protagonist(one of?)of THIS story will be like &how the story will change becuz of the merge?Will either protag’s role change a bit or a lot"
5,"Aug 26, 2020",how nostalgic kim dokja being chuuni
5,"Aug 26, 2020","Hmm, if they used like sanitizer or mouthwash, or even soap, wouldn't it still count as killing organisms (bacteria in this case)?? "

5,"Aug 26, 2020",This webtoon Is probably gonna be tower of god length based on the light novel (and the lore gets hella thick later on aswell like tog) so we might be here for a couple of years (but it's so worth it)
5,"Aug 6, 2022",Alcohol can kill millions germs they are stupid.
5,"Aug 1, 2022",no matter how many times i re-read this chapter i can’t help feeling disgusted when they grouped up and stomped the old woman.

5,"May 29, 2022","This is amazing! I just started reading, however, I love it so much! It kind of reminds me of the Anime, Sword Art Online, where the characters get trapped into a virtual reality video game where they play until they die! Very interesting and thrilling concept! Love to keep reading!"
5,"May 22, 2022","i was thinkin they could all literally use hand sanitizer, since bacteria is a living organism, be a funny twist"

5,"Jan 30, 2022",kill a freaking plant brooooooooooo
5,"Jan 22, 2022",Says living organisms so ain’t the kid got some bugs 😬 they living..
5,"Jan 16, 2022","I mean I know a lot of you are saying “they can just kill a bug” but in a moment of pressure and commotion people can really easily forget that a living organism applies to a bug also, so yeah I would be shitting my pants instead of thinking the basic of biology that’s why props to those who can think properly in a life or death situation😫🙌🏻"
5,"Jan 9, 2022",Since it said kill a living organism it doesn’t mean it’s limited to just humans so what if you take the roaches the kid was holding in his box and killed them? I think that would count.
5,"Jan 7, 2022",there is an entire container full of crickets that a kid is holding. kill them. it’s not hard
5,"Jan 5, 2022",what about them cicadas that kid had. Its a living organism probably.
5,"Jan 4, 2022",Spray hand sanitizer on yourself or parts of the train. Now you have killed some living organism (bacteria) without the need to kill a person. Mission complete.
5,"Jan 2, 2022",poor grandma 😭kids respect your elders
5,"Dec 21, 2021",Me over here reading at 1 AM when I have to get up to work tomorrow at 7 in the morning. 😅😌

5,"Nov 8, 2021","I mean,it says ANY living organism,so couldnt you just kill one of those roaches that kid had in his pot thingy? It doesnt say humans in specific"
5,"Oct 23, 2021",dude just kill the fcking insects that the little boy is carrying
5,"Oct 22, 2021","I was literally thinking the whole time just find the ants or other BS on the train
Or idk… the stupid crap that kid had in the box that they literally focused on"
5,"Oct 9, 2021",I screamed way too loudly out of excitment.
5,"Sep 23, 2021","wash your hands, kill the bacteria"

5,"May 15, 2021",this is super good so far. first webtoon I've read 
5,"May 5, 2021",I’ve been hoping the last two episodes that people would just be smart and kill the bugs that little boy has. I guess they’ll end up doing that cuz otherwise the author wouldn’t have made it a point to show us them. 
5,"May 1, 2021",Namwoon Kim sounds like Namjoon Kim 
5,"May 1, 2021",kill the cockroaches you idiots!
5,"May 1, 2021",why did no one consider just spraying some cleaner on a handrail? germs are living organisms after all
5,"Apr 29, 2021","if only yall were carrying plant,then u can just squeeze that? XD?"
5,"Apr 29, 2021",Your body is constantly killing microorganisms though... 🤔

5,"Apr 20, 2021",And don’t forget single cell organisms! The wording of the challenge makes the loop holes very exploitable
5,"Apr 13, 2021","If the punishment is death, if you killed yourself, wouldn't you complete the challenge and be ressurected ?"
5,"Apr 11, 2021",I guess the author doesn't know that we literally kill millions of microorganisms every time we breathe
5,"Apr 7, 2021",why is everyone overestimating humanity's capability of being calm and collected and undestimating the cleanliness of the car lol
5,"Mar 10, 2021",Remind me of Alice in the borderland??!
5,"Mar 3, 2021","Tbh, I wouldn’t be able to recall word by word what I read 10 years ago. My respects for Dokja"
5,"Mar 1, 2021",The cockroach
5,"Feb 27, 2021","I haven't read ahead, but I get the feeling that he takes the kid's bugs and that it will count as a kill."
5,"Feb 25, 2021",B-but what if the main dude that his waiting was actually him 😶......
5,"Feb 25, 2021",Wait but cells are living organisms so what if they just like gave themselves a paper cut
5,"Feb 23, 2021",The panel with the surprised look- too cute. Thank you.
5,"Feb 23, 2021",this is so exciting JAJAJAJAJA
5,"Jan 21, 2021","not everyone becoming homicidal the moment they realize they have to go feral 😭 dude just think for a minute-- yes, they're probably going to be stressed which would hinder their ability to think properly-- but the best thing to do here is to calm down"
5,"Jan 17, 2021","So I've been putting off reading this comic bc I wanna binge-read and now that I'm 4 eps in I cant put it down. From the art to the story line, everything is just purely amazing! "

5,"Dec 2, 2020","it said any living organisms and you guys remember the little boy who had those insects in a box? They could just kill them, and Im sure to can find some fly's or other bugs on the train"
5,"Nov 25, 2020",Bacteria are also organisms so...maybe use hand sanitizer? 😅 jk
5,"Nov 13, 2020","hold on, if all they have to do is kill a living organism can't they all just put on some hand sanitizer to kill some bacteria? "

5,"Oct 17, 2020",why don't they kill that boy's roaches instead?
5,"Oct 17, 2020","yeah, I was thinking about the natural microorganisms that live on our skin and stuff. Can't someone just borrow a lighter, burn a patch of skin, and count it as killing 1,000,000 bacteria?"
5,"Oct 16, 2020",if they were outside they could have just picked a flower or a thing of grass. since they're down there they could try to look for a bug or a rat. maybe even clean to kill germs. it's a huge advantage that the rules don't specifically say to kill another person
5,"Oct 15, 2020","It's just horrible that they ahd to kill that old woman and that little kid had to see them doing that. Also, what will Dokja do?"

5,"Aug 27, 2020",Damn how would y’all feel irl tho? Knowing you’re not the main character and how the main characters are supposed to deliver a good ending but that means you’re supposed to die as an insignificant character but you have the knowledge of what can make you a main character and the right actions you’re supposed to take to become one? You feel like a cheat but at the same time don’t want to die ion know how I’d react in all honesty
5,"Aug 27, 2020","Since the objective is to kill any ""living organism"", can't the young boy in that one scene kill whatever animal is in his carrier or whatever you call it? (I'm not a animal person but it's called a carrier right? Like the one for insects?)"

5,"Nov 8, 2021",Sooooo hear me out. We have like billions of bacterias on our skin and they are technically living organisms? billions of coins? heck ya. *randomly spraying rubbing alcohol* 
5,"Nov 8, 2021",Wbt the kid with the roaches it didn’t specify it had to be humans specifically 
5,"Nov 2, 2021",The kid with bugs.... sorry spoiler
5,"Oct 28, 2021",i have decided to just read to the coment bar so nothing will be spoiled lol. love this toon
5,"Oct 26, 2021",Wait so that kid has the advantage because they can just kill the cockroach or whatever and they’ll be fine

5,"Sep 24, 2021",Idk if my science failed me or not (it's been a while okay...) those grass hoppers or crickets (idk) are considered living organisms right? Or am I wrong???
5,"Sep 22, 2021",oh my goodness!!!! They are also experiencing the New Normal way XD

5,"Sep 1, 2021",I'd be so bad in this game that even if i found a fly to kill I'd really struggle to catch it. smhh
5,"Aug 21, 2021",Top comment brought up the loophole I was thinking of. I was thinking insects or rats. They're trapped in the cabin but I noticed the boy with the roaches is in their cabin. Loophole 😁
5,"Aug 18, 2021",If only they had just looked at the kid with the crickets...
5,"Aug 18, 2021",You could kill a bug or just use hand sanitizer which will kill bacteria.
5,"Aug 16, 2021",Does applying hand sanitizer to kill bacteria count?
5,"Aug 14, 2021","the kid in the train has insects with him, kill those... Poor kid has to watch epople die, how old would he be, like that is literally torture"
5,"Aug 14, 2021",the kid has a bug thingy. They should kill those
5,"Aug 7, 2021",so you can kill a plant because it's still a living organism right?
5,"Jul 31, 2021","PLOT HOLE: in TWSA, the scene goes: in train cabin 3707, the protagonist (YJH) kills everyone to survive. cz he's the protag, the writing is ofc centered around him. Dokja is in cabin 3807, a train car behind YJH. in previous episode, Dokja remembers quotes from TWSA that are describing his situation in train cabin 3807 perfectly rn. but why do those lines (""a dokkaebi w/antennae"", ""a litter of dead bodies in the subway cabin"", etc) even exist? *continued in reply"
5,"Jul 22, 2021",cant they just kill the cockroaches or whatever the kid had in his little box thing as pets I meannnnnnn
5,"Jul 21, 2021","""In this world It's kill or be killed"" "
5,"Jul 4, 2021","very stupid move, he's just going to end up with a useless  love interest teammate who  tries to save everyone and ends up dying pr becoming a huge burden on everyone until the end of the series "
5,"Jun 30, 2021","haha he had actually forgot some of the part, and lmao his ability to read fast(sherlock👀)"
5,"Jun 16, 2021","Aren't the cockroaches the kid has living organisms? Couldn't they have just killed that? But then again, in a situation like that who would have thought of it?"
5,"Jun 14, 2021",ANY LIVING ORGANISM YALL YOU CAN JUST KILL A FLY OR SOMETHING 😭
5,"Jun 9, 2021",KILL THE CRICKETS…
5,"Jun 3, 2021",why does namwoon look like kaido but evil

5,"Jun 1, 2021",there must be insects or something on the train
5,"Jun 1, 2021","this is buetiful and deserves an award, I can't wait to read all of this."
5,"May 28, 2021","Dang Dokja, your brain work fast 😂 Also, Namwoon has a point too. But instead of playing the dokkaebi's game, use the time to think of loopholes. It said living organisms, not human"
5,"May 20, 2021",I have just started to read the series and it's soooooooooo intresting
5,"May 19, 2021",The constelation [The sleepy chaos] admire the rivality of killing a bug and killing a human for more point with some fun.

5,"Apr 29, 2021","Man, get these guys some hand sanitizer and kill a couple million bacteria. "
5,"Apr 29, 2021",We all got brains it was the first thing I thought of I was like so if I see a bug I can just kill it and we would have been good but them dumb people were too quick to kill a grandma smh 
5,"Apr 28, 2021",it's kill or be killed🌻
5,"Apr 27, 2021",That namwoon Kim looks like a serious version of kaidou from saiki k lol 
5,"Apr 27, 2021",hm well it  seems that things are really starting  now it's sad that everything is changing for them but it will be  fine 
5,"Apr 27, 2021",mc kinda reminds me of matsuda from death note somehow 
5,"Apr 26, 2021","aw man I already hate that kim guy. it can't be helped if he wishes to adapt to the new world and survive, but the fact that he attacked and killed an elderly while acting all tough is just fucking low, b*tch couldn't even pick on someone his own size. "
5,"Apr 26, 2021","oh that's interesting!! it's like he's being given the chance to be a parallel protagonist! so he might follow the army lieutenant to the 'real' protagonist, and be shadowing the storyline from there!"
5,"Apr 26, 2021",this. is. sooooo. gooooood!!!!!!!!
5,"Apr 26, 2021","kill any living organisms, the crickets that the kid across mc was containing. it didn't specify human so..."
5,"Apr 26, 2021",honestly I would've just killed the cockroaches the boy's holding lol
5,"Apr 26, 2021","That boy was... holding a bug box... so... for organisms, you could just... ugh, people are so weird"

5,"Apr 26, 2021",pro- professor Frost... i- is that you?
5,"Apr 23, 2021",That moment you sanitize your hands and kill hundreds of living organisms
5,"Apr 22, 2021","wait... I think that one kid was holding insects, isn't he?? So, they're living organisms"
5,"Apr 7, 2021","some are talking about how they could've found some random insect to kill instead of this mess, but first of all, not to sound presumptuous, but this is a modern city in South Korea. wouldn't they have clean ass subways that really likely would have close to no insects at all? second, the vehicle is full of people. what. they're all gonna unifyingly search for bugs together in under 10 minutes? "
5,"Apr 1, 2021",can't type because it's too interesting to wait even a second. 😍
5,"Mar 22, 2021","Since the top comment almost got it right, you can just go back to one of the previous chapters and find a scene/panel that is the clue. You'll know when you see it~"
5,"Mar 11, 2021",maybe you are HE?
5,"Mar 8, 2021",I just realized that the kid have an insects in his box but other people ignore it. incest are living organism... Duhh killing an old lady instead of an insect what a dumb 🙄
5,"Feb 26, 2021","""This episode contains violent Behaviour...""  Huh...How come I've read and watched more deadlier things than this. "
5,"Feb 14, 2021",kill living organism- goddamn just squashed that cockroaches that the kid have why are ppl so dense 😭

5,"Aug 28, 2020",This is so cool!! I love it already!🤧✨
5,"Aug 28, 2020","question: the MC read the light novel for ten years. Are we expecting this webtoon to last for at least 10 years also?  I don't wanna see scenarios getting skipped or condescended in one chapter. 3000 chapters of what... filler? heelll naaaaww. You better keep your end of the bargain, author. hahahaha 😂😂😂🤣🤣"
5,"Aug 28, 2020",yo this better just be a story because we know how the webtoon goes.🤔

5,"Aug 27, 2020",What is that link in everyone’s replies?? Is it a spam or a hacker or smth?
5,"Aug 27, 2020",Is anyone else thinking how it said organism not person that includes bugs like spiders or even the ones that kid had Crickets?they don’t have to kill anyone they just have to be smart about it 
5,"Aug 27, 2020",I've been thinking that little boy has a box full of roaches why couldn't they just kill those I've been waiting all these chapters but WHY IS NO ONE THINKING OF THAT
5,"Aug 27, 2020",This webtoon you can read it in some website in google free like i do they reach the chapter 18 now and it also have a novel with more than 100 chapter
5,"Aug 27, 2020",Oh no.. this is one of those webtoons that I'd rather binge-read in one sitting.. it's going to be pure agony to wait for it to update all the time T__T
5,"Aug 27, 2020","Yo thats cool, but what if someone kills that kids insects? it says a living organism not a person :("
5,"Aug 27, 2020",Undertale kil or be killed
5,"Aug 27, 2020","While waiting for this WEBTOON to update I’ve already read to CH 136: Episode 26 in the Webnovel. You should be able to get to CH 43: Episode 10 before the premium content, but if you use Qidian underground you can read it all if you don’t want to wait!)"
5,"Aug 27, 2020",I can’t help to think about the box the kid is holding since the beginning.
5,"Aug 27, 2020","——————LISTEN UPPPPPPP————————-This mc is AMAZING and VERY sassy. So I’d recommend y’all to give him a voice according to that (it’s pretty tough to decide voices of the characters, especially in a webtoon). Example: Does anyone remember that ROAST? Yoo Sangah: I think it’s speaking Spanish....should I talk to it? Dokja: NO! What are you gonna do huh? Ask it for money? S. A. V. A. G. E."
5,"Aug 27, 2020",did bakugo show up??
5,"Aug 27, 2020",Just kill a fly or something lmao

5,"Aug 26, 2020",there were some insects one of the passengers was carrying. that could easily save live rn🤔🤔🤔
5,"Aug 26, 2020",Can't they just kill some ants? I mean it only says kill a living organism
5,"Aug 26, 2020","From the beginning, I’ve wondered if killing a bug or anything living would qualify, since the rules said “living organism” not “human.” This, of course, would need to be verified by the demon, which may be risky, due to it’s volatile nature. But if it did qualify, *squish those bugs and sanitize as fast as possible, people * "
5,"Aug 26, 2020",this kinda gives me solo leveling vibes (a little bit) so i’m completely down for this series 😂
5,"Aug 26, 2020",why didn't they just kill the bugs or trees or something 
5,"Aug 26, 2020",Our immune system kills bacteria all the time. No one should die.

5,"Aug 26, 2020",Kinda like Danganronpa in a way :7
5,"Aug 26, 2020","If someone just uses some hand sanitizer to kill the bacteria in the train, they would all be okay..."
5,"Aug 26, 2020","Is Dokja gonna be ""him"" (the protagonist of TWSA)?"
5,"Aug 26, 2020",That moment your phone becomes the most valuable asset to your survival.
5,"Aug 26, 2020",So... at this point I pull out hand sanitizer and start rubbing it in everything hoping a germ bites it 
5,"Aug 26, 2020",MUST. NOT. USE. FREE. COI-  [Enjoy!]

5,"Aug 26, 2020",I think it's smart using the plot of the story to his advantage. I do think he'll end up being one of the protagonists because I feel like the one he is waiting for is himself. I also feel like the author of TWSA sent him the story to assist him 
5,"Aug 26, 2020",There are actually 18 episodes out. Just search on Google and you can read more
5,1 days ago,"doesn't matter because they're the author, if one of their management or whatever team staff, idk but if one of them shares it with someone without the approval of the author, they might get sued, or sent to jail, well atleast that's what I know, I might be wrong but just roll with it "

5,"Aug 26, 2020",Theory - I think MC here is going to realize that He is the Actual Main Character of the Comic that he is waiting for to come and that is the gift of the Author.
5,"Aug 26, 2020",GYAAAAAAA
5,"Aug 26, 2020",This is why you should always carry a pocket full of lizards.
5,"Aug 26, 2020",getting swallowed more and more by each chapter 
5,"Aug 26, 2020","Well that !! from earlier I shouted "" They said to kill a freaking living organism not a f*cking human!"
5,"Aug 26, 2020",is cellular life considered as organism?
5,"Aug 26, 2020",I wish I could read faster. 
5,"Aug 26, 2020",Im already done for this comic deep in

5,"Aug 26, 2020",this will became another fav action webtoon .... I love it your first chapter give me a goosebumps so read it all the way till now and I will only say it worth my time ...love your work
5,"Aug 26, 2020",At toonily it is 18 chapters already
5,"Aug 26, 2020",I was thinking of insects too. Probably speaks on how humans are in such a situation
5,"Aug 26, 2020",it's only been five episodes and I can't wait for the next 
5,"Aug 26, 2020","18 chapters are out on mangakakalot, just letting y'all know"
5,"Aug 26, 2020","i keep bugged, there's a bug catcher kid before right, the quest is to kill a living things, so you can just crush the bug and clear the quest right? why is that didn't cross his mind"
5,"Aug 26, 2020",dame it i need more im a cryyyyyyy
5,"Aug 26, 2020",that was the present. The file of the novel was the present.
5,"Aug 26, 2020",THIS IS AMAZING 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
5,"Aug 26, 2020",wow I kinda feel that I will gonna read this until the end 😅
5,"Aug 26, 2020","Really, why don't they just kill the bugs in that kid's terrarium?  the rules didn't say you had to kill a human, just to kill a living thing.  Seems like an obvious solution, honestly..."
5,"Aug 26, 2020",THIS IS SO GOOD
5,"Aug 26, 2020",So I’ve been thinking about this. It said any living organisms. That would count as animals right. I can imagine a kid holding an Ant farm and someone just takes the glass and shatters it and tells everyone to step on only one ant....poor ants 
5,"Aug 26, 2020",Thank you WEBTOONs for a way to  read unordinary for free so my dad dont gotta bitch about me spending his card for 1$ twice a month
5,"Aug 26, 2020",Does anybody else get bummed when they see the little grey box that’s before the little gray box that’s tells you you gotta give up your coins? 🆒🆒🆒
5,"Aug 26, 2020","up to chapter 18 already, every entertaining story"
5,"Aug 26, 2020",that's sad they were beating up the old lady o think?🤔
5,"Aug 26, 2020",Literally made an account to comment! Love this need more!!
5,"Aug 26, 2020",ummm... so if you can kill any LIVING organisms can maybe they should use sanitizers. That'll do the thing. right? Or there was a little guy with an insects collection right? Beetles or something. They might also count
5,"Aug 26, 2020",Wait if they just want some living ORGANISMS to die can’t they all just kill some bacteria or 🦠 with sanitizers? Nobody said that it had to be HUMANS who should be killed 
5,"Aug 26, 2020","It sux that I can read all this rn in the other app, but it is so much better this way. Edit: but altogether, so far it’s AMAZING keep up the hard work author"
5,"Aug 26, 2020",Wow extremely short was gonna sit and commit but I guess I’ll be back when there is content. 
5,"Aug 26, 2020",Gah I’m so happy it’s here!!!! Now I just gotta find a way to see Solo Leveling on here too

5,"Aug 26, 2020","Kill or be killed, haha, Undertale ^^"
5,"Aug 26, 2020","Fun fact from the LN: the MC is actually so ugly, he gets several nicknames, my favourite being “ugly squid”Also there is absolutely zero romance in this just saying"

5,"Sep 11, 2022",This series has a big problem with disparity of knowledge between Dokja and readers. Dokja always has crucial knowledge beforehand but he doesn't share it with readers. Instead information is only given when needed. Items and other things have hidden functionalities and features that Dokja just knows. Any problems that appear are already known by Dokja and he has a solution prepared that he can just showoff. By 80 ep he is yet to explain the overarching story of twsa and his plan for survival.
