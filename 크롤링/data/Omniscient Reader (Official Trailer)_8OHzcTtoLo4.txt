"I'm just a reader"
Me : then who am I? :")))))) Han sooyong is the writer I dont really read novel, specially Korean ones. But I Must say, ORV is an Amazing, well-Created Story. From all the Mangas or Novel I have read, never I feel so confused with the plot and stuff, Yet feeling hungry to know what happens next and keep reading as if its something that must be read. The ending was unexpected for me, even tho a friend of mine who introduce me to it has giving a few big spoilers(whcih I asked them to, since I need spoiler to keep reading), I never seen a Novel/Manga with an ending like that, an Ending that makes you feel as if you are the "???" Of the story.. I just finished reading chapter 43, to me, it felt like the theatre owner is the author of the novel because he blushed when dokja pierced through his forehead after entering dokja's mind/ memories ,where he saw the texts of the novel... This is probably the best official webtoon trailer I see, props! It's intriguing, straight to the point, intense, and sells the story for exactly what it is. Very nice! Will get animation or something 😁 A song that really suits this webtoon/novel is

:) good luck to fellow readers This NEEDS to be an anime so  would without a doubt be WAY better than  some of the main stream ones that are popular ATM. Reading the novel then the comic  make it even more impactful cant imagine how bad ass the fire dragon scene would be not to mention the other disasters. Yeah. I'm just a Reader cool wow! I am reading this manga now! I'm dying of  curiousity. What actually is Kim Dokja? What is that one thing even we as readers are still unaware of? The contellation, Conie, recommends everyone to read this piece of art. i read this webtoon months ago and finally decided to read the novel too. finished it recently, and just WOWWwW i don't regret ever reading it, even tho it's probably the only thing i did this summer lol series is so good Are we getting an adaptation of this? Movie or anime I don't mind as long as it's good. This deserves a great adaptation whenever i reread the novel, i always amaze by how beautiful the author convey the idea and the story telling the story that started in a subway I LOVE orv, because of this, i got to read the entirety of the novel. spoiler alert,







it's an open ending. so you get to imagine whatever ending you want 💀 there's also multiple loops and paradoxes in the novel, so it's one hell of a roller coaster. I recommend for ppl to read the novel too if you dont like waiting for new chapters of the manhwa. ANYWAYS, orv rules Love it. mamhwa readers will never know.... how amazing this series is gonna get.. here after chap 551 on the novel.. HAHA dies its so good to the point i binge watch all chapters in a day😂 DOKJAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA   \(●□●)/ I recently finished this novel and I have never in my life read anything better. I stayed awake until 3 am crying over the ending. It has left me feeling so many emotions but at the same time so empty. This was the greatest read ever. I highly highly recommend it to anyone. Towards the end when everything gets revelaed, your mind will truly be blown. I will never forget this. I miss Dokja already. So much, and the rest too. Unpopular opinion but Omniscient reader > Solo levelling I love Dokja cuz he's so sly and clever. Plus, I can't get enough of the side characters. MC is trash. weak compared to the original old MC.  a weak MC always needs plot armor. noobs in the comments saying it has no plot armor forgot that if you wanna save a weak MC you need tons of plot armor. I hope they will animate ORV in the future. From I seen this is like that show with time traveling microwave. Just pure insanity. 나는 일본인입니다. 나는 이 작품을 사랑한다. 한국인이 일본에 나쁜 인상을 가지고 있다는 것을 알고 있습니다. 그렇지만, 이 작품 덕분에, 테스트로 이순신을 정답 할 수 있었습니다. 나는 어리석은가? I usually don't like reading long, I can't believe I wanted more chapters. Never gonna stop promoting this until every person in this world knows it !! I love dokja so much Dokja is pretty much Anos Voldigoad now lol My favorite webtoon This is easily the best webtoon I’ve ever read. It’s an absolute 10/10. What is the writer name? What chapter does the thumbnail appear?? This Web Trailer that got me into Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint in the First place. The series is soo good that when I ran out of chapters online I Started reading the Novel Version. Well... fuck. That looked pretty damn good. If I didn't already read it, this would have me hunting for it in a heartbeat. My friend:I'm thinking if I should join orv fandom

Me:You should!!! Things you will get when you join are pain, depression, grief, sadness, sorrow, tears, you losing your sanity, and most importantly you'll lose your straightness

My friend:girl what?😧

*I'm still trying to convince her to join the fandom lol* i've read the novel over 4 times already the best I LOVE YOU KIM DOKJA!!! I've caught up to the current chapter  and am now reading the web novel. The main character is relateable. I am reading this novel to cope with what's going on in reality. I have GAD and this honestly helps me distract my mind from everything. I am enamored by it. It's truly a good story. A story about stories. ORV ANIME WHEN my favorite novel of all time💞💞💞 Really hope this series gets animated one day The best story have the best mc, Dokja driving me crazyyyyy afbafhsfhsfjtahgcvdvaahf The novel got me crying tho- See you guys inside a subway 10 years later Que delicia de webtoon meus amigos Can u imagine when the webtoon gets to 188 lol bro im bawling my eyes out I hope this comic become anime Yoo Joonghyuk: Who are you
Lee Jihye: *gasps in Korean* master! He is obviously the love of your life! I came expecting copper but holy shit I found a gem mine. I literally thought it's your typical action comic containing all the tropes you'd find in the book and now I'm reading what could've be one of the best webnovels to grace this dark planet. truly one of the best When we say you guys are not ready... trust us for what is about to come, your jaws are about to fall and fall hard To the ppl who doesn't ship jungheok x dokja and say dokja x sooyoung or dokja x sangah is better, just imagine Jungheok was a girl, then y'all wouldn't have spent a sec to ship them.
Your double standards are showing, homophobic eh? I love dokja I have read Solo Leveling, and many  adventure webtoon. However,  I must say Omniscient Reader is my favorite one. It gave me great feeling, so much emotion happy and sad, love and hates, rather than just fight and fight. I also love the development of support characters.  And, the best part is the chemistry between Kim Dokja and Yoo Jong Huyk haha I am Yoo Junghyeok reading omniscient reader’s viewpoint was the best decision i’ve ever made, i seriously love it so much Will this getting animated? I never really enjoy reading an action fantasy manhwa but this series got me fixated with my phone for the whole 97 chapters so far
for 2 days straight
I never feel so curious about a story 
because I can't guess what will happen next
Kim Dokja is unpredictable  and I love it! I love you I should've read this much earlier but i think I'm not that late too! So far so great! I'm currently on chapter 70 on its webtoon and I'm so excited Oh god I just feel bad for the people who can’t see the actual novel!! I shouldn’t compare works but honestly this is the best novel I’ve read since Harry Potter. It really feels like there’s a person named Dokja out there. How the authors(the novel writers Shing and Shong) carry out the plot is amazing!! It’s not just the plot, how they describe the scenes and the raw emotions, is beyond art. Believe me, it’s the best thing I’ve read so far and the webtoon is good too. I'm coming back again lmao Since it has a vibe from re: zero so i like it even more i read the Light Novel and all i can say is.... *perfect* Period. what happened to this and the solo levelling anime ? Tuyệt vời hi vọng ra phim Lol their is also novel Sheesh is it been already 1 year damn The moving images made me realize how amazing this would be as an animated series with the same/similar artstyle. Honestly it's a damn good webtoon like seriously it has such an intricate plot so guys please stop comparing this to manhwas like solo leveling. Although i don't hate solo leveling it has a simple storyline but the thing is the side characters get overlooked a lot and the existence of gods and monsters and other worlds felt shoehorned and that makes up for an unsatisfying ending. while on the other hand omniscient reader has a complex story amazing character development and main character kim dokja doesn't punch his way out of every situation like sun jinwoo .No Dokja uses his knowledge of this new world, he makes use of his party members , he always has a plan and that's the thing like about him the most . honestly this webtoon deserves more attention. now again that said i am not in any way saying that solo leveling is inferior to orv. i have read solo leveling believe me it was a very entertaining read but what orv does is it takes some of the elements from SL, fills in the stuff that SL was missing and makes it much enjoyable. would recommend 10/10 Ohh this has a trailer?!?!?!?! To everyone who finished the novel, What kind of ending do you want?😭 This is best novel I've ever read! Highly recommend! Only later does he realize he creates entire universe as a dream and the dream becomes reality while he becomes the god WOAHH listening to mitski while reading novel chapter 188 was the best thing..made me so hyped!. Please make this into a good extremely well animated anime ufotable or someone else huge. HYPEEEEEEEEEEE Wait what he didn't wanted to change the ending he just helping people who didn't survive in the novel... When I searched it said that there will be a movie but it's impossible to cover that much important things in a movie+ manwha too seems to be not ending soon enough.... I hope it's anime series The story make my day but the ending ruin my day WOW! It looks dope as heck! first ever manhwa that made me read the novel, guess what? didn't regret anything, man u don't have any idea how crazy i am for kdj 😌🖤✨✨ Han Sooyoung my wife What are the authors official accounts?? GILYEON IS WORTHY!!!! DOKJA WORLD DOMINATION 🛐 cant help but compare how the mc and his coworker lady look similar to the mc and the first healer lady of solo leveling, offcourse the plots of both novels are like hell and heaven (totally different ) this felt like it came from an Avengers movie trailer oly frick im getting goosegumps Why is there a Manhwa in a webtoon channel? ORV is absolutely amazing. 
I read the whole novel a few months ago and am up-to-date with the webtoon.      
[It was also my first webnovel, so its really special for me.]

The story plot is very different from the normal 'MC read the novel and becomes OP' trope. 
The way the mysteries of the many characters converge into a single twist is absolutely genius. 
Definitely an amazing read. Love this one! Give it a try, you won't regret reading this webtoon (and the novel) is probably the greatest thing I've done in my entire life and then he realizes that he is the oldest dream/most ancient dream これさめっちゃ面白い…！！！！

翻訳して読むのって意外と疲れるし… ✨ D E P R E S S I O N ✨ as a comic <3 HUEHHH SAYANGKU dokja bau mayad:' this novel takung reader and bromance and tsundere to the whole new level يا جمعه متى رح ينزل قولوا بسرعه رجاً 
O Friday, when is it going to come down, say quickly, please I had read the manhwa first before finishing the novel... And goddamn orv manhwa now feels way different after all those chapters of the novel.  My perception of the manhwa as i was reading it for the first time was how refreshing it was and plot is packed af. Now i've finished the novel, manhwa's atmosphere became heavy. It's not like the manhwa failed to capture the angst of the novel, it was my expectations who failed me for not noticing the angst beforehand lol "If I continue to regress will I ever get to meet you again?" I know I'm late about it but it's actually so funny when he says "I'm just a reader" he's also saying his own name XD I like the novel, especially the dokja character 😘❤ 아 전지적 독자 시점이구나ㅋㅋ God I watched this trailer in an ad a year ago and I was like, "wow this looks like generic garbage." One year later I'm 300 chapters in when I realized this trailer was for the webtoon adaptation of orv. This is one of the best web toons I have read in the past year. TOG got too complicated and muggy whereas this is fun, to the point, and surprising. I'm 100% sure that no one can hurt me anymore, thx orv *Painful screach* Just a random Comment DAMN HOPE THEY MAKE THIS MASTER PIECE INTO AN ANIME JUST LIKE SOLO LEVELING The best. fiction. novel. ever!! Okay but it is hard for me not to be scared that this is a other way the story will spread and then the hell will start. I wonder if it is just in Korea or in all the world. I almost done the novel,  I only have two things to say one, Im depressed and two this is a masterpiece 전지적 독자 시점은 웹 소설도 재밌지 Es tan hermoso que voy a llorar i finally reread it and i have realized a lot.. something that i never realize when i first read it. This story is for just that one reader. WEBTOON you need to drop a physical version of the manwha because it is 100% true to the novel’s content (istg the novel is amazing, it never fails to make me cry and laugh) and the art is amazing. Just take my money 😫 MASTERPIECE - that's what ORV is  !- honestly one of my favorite webtoons bc the story is so interesting Spoiler tag:






Dokja is a great role model for Gilyoung best. LN. I have seen. Hands Down. Reading the novel's ending while listening to cold play's Everglow made me cry like a river I love dokja sm😫 I cry everytime I remember the novel I have love-hate relationship to masterpieces like this 😭. I've just know about the epilogue of this webtoon in its webnovel and it's just wholesome and sad at the same time for me. The type of story that you know that it's super amazing but wholesomely broke your heart at the same time 😭. I love how the true substance of this story isn't something like wish fulfillment OP MC with corny romance and power fantasy hype despite being under the system/apocalypse theme.

The story is incredible albeit painfully slow burn and there's no telling what happens.
The charm doesn't only stick and revolve around the MC and the side characters don't feel one-dimensional and actually progresses on and off screen. There's no pandering or delay in each chapter and story progression is real here. Every mystery is unfolded throughout the story and plot holes are properly concluded. 

I truly appreciate plot-centric stories like this, literal gold. For whoever still doubt whether to read this webtoon or no, YOU MUST READ IT, IT IS SO GREATTTTTT, YOU WONT REGRET IT, I ALREADY READ THE WEBTOON VERSION (ON-GOING) & NOVEL (FINISHED - english translated)🤩🤩🤩🤩

IT'S REALLY THE BEST THING IVE EVER READ🤩😆😆😆😭💙💙💙💙💙 "I'm just a reader" soooooo badass 😍 One of the best webnovel I've read so faarrr. IM IN LOVE WITH ALL OF THE CHARACTERS HEREEE. I still can't believe at the ending. Mind blowing🤧 와우...840 만회... God Ive only seen that many episodes on web novel both the mc and the author are dedicated I love this story too much- Thisss is reallyyyy good i remember i stayed up late night to finish my planned chapters Hiii!! I have a question. Is it advisable to read the novel first before the manhwa or i could read the manhwa first? Are there a lot of revised details in the manhwa adaptation or is it just the same? [Constellation 'Procrastinator Reader's ■■ is Depression ] [Constellation 'THE MOST ANCIENT DREAM' is dreaming his final dream] Hoi The HYYYYYYYPE‼️😆✊ i love this novel more than my entire life If Dokja is a reader of the novel wouldn't that make him living in his own fanfic? I got goosebumps. Is there something like revolution gonna happen here? 4.7k who dislike will be either cut off from sponsorship or wiped out by the Demon Judge of Fire pleas add arabic language to webtoon app If you haven’t started the web novel yet don’t do it unless you want to be addicted and lose many hours of sleep Mam I am towards the ending of the Light Novel and I also read the webtoon too .... And have only one thing to say and that is 'this thing is dope'.
In both LN and Webtoon the plot is indescribably great. * sigh * But the novel already Gave me depression. Imagine the reading it again in pictures. If you're reading this story, it means you're going to a therapist. I´M CRYING Feels like solo leveling What's the soundtrack title [Constellation, Demon-like Judge of Fire is jumping up and down from this comradeship.] lindo Nangisin dokja *One of the Holy Trinity webnovels of South Korea for a reason* No way... 
I CAN'T WAIT TO WATCH IT AAAHHHH
😭😭😭 this is such a well written story the MC is smart and charismatic and the side characters too are also very well written. its one of the webtoons i enjoyed reading the most. Im also planning on reading the novel because i cant wait for the other chapters to come lol. I just got caught up to the manhwa and I’m currently reading the novel- and so far I’m scared because of all those warnings-😥 Can I get this anime plz kthx The “I just wanted to escape reality” part really really hurt me as a novel reader. i live this manhwa more than my entire life I got CHILLS We need a anime of That Did anyone notice that we are readers too Solo leveling?
Wanna fight over which is better?
This masterpiece of a story cant be compared to anything 
I assure you
Novel reader I remember reading chapter 1 of the webtoon something about the atmosphere felt so real im in pain 🥺💔 I have just started reading this and am already loving all of it. Best decision ever. Worth it! Love this webtoon very much, although he is not op but the way he handle up the situation is very clever I just finished reading the 58th one and OH MY GOD IT'S SO GOOD WHAT Constellation *secretive plotter* smirks in amusement DID YOU SEE THE CHAPTER THAT CAME OUT YESTERDAY Till now we haven't seen many of these constellations After finishing the novel, I can’t even not-cry when I hear Kim Dokja cause like— *incoherent sobbing* Me: Kim Dokja
Webtoon: Dokja Kim
My brain: I do not comprehend This one deserve an anime *See you all in 10 years.* this is like one of my favorite webnovels 😭 IM FRICKIN IN LOVE WITH THIS SERIES ITS GREAT I LOVE IT The story is great. Trust me. I freaking love Omniscient Reader!!!♥️♥️♥️♥️ ngl, this webtoon can be a kseries I loved the webnovel and i am loving the manhwa. Found a gem. Wowww The most simultaneously overpowered and not overpowered character I’ve seen in a while lol. He’s interesting because he doesn’t stick to moral high ground. He seemed so shut off and uncertain before it happened, but when the apocalypse came his underlying character burst through and took control Constellation Demon like judge of fire says what incarnation Kim Dokja and incarnation Yoo Junghyuk have is comradeship. The animation of the moving hair, mouth, and eyes are so fucking smooth and cool. I'm dying for an animation because let's be honest, ORV will kill it it gets an anime adaptation. Aaaaaaa Dokjaaaaaa Yep, I just started reading this and it was amazing 👌🏼 Omfg I just realized omniscient reader's viewpoint is just ways of survival with it's reader (Dokja) inserted. So when's the collab with hero cantare? god dammit, dokja's so hot ;-; Look at the dislikes of the trailer. ORV is so hated lol. They must have hated it because its a great story. 전독시 사랑해!!! 김독자 사랑해!!!! 김컴사랑해!!!!!! 싱숑들 사랑해!!!!! Bro.... memories... Constellation of abysys black dragon emperor is watching your black dragon. 
This was op😂😂😂 I wish this have an anime adaptation What all tags is this toon? Like zombie etc Rise dokja simps it’s time So far this is my favorite thing that I've ever read My fav manhwa ever 이것은, 오직 단 한사람의 독자를 위한 이야기이다.

This is a story for only one reader(dokja). The HYYYYYYYPE‼ 😁👊 개멋져 I like it bc the main protagonist isn’t your typical one, he knows how to take advantage of people and isn’t the kind-hearted one you would expect. He’s not evil either. He isn’t OP but he can still get the job done using his abilities and allys he has by his side Few facts comparison between Omniscient Reader Viewpoint (ORV) and Solo Leveling (SL):-

Along their existence is a special power gifted to some humans, giving the latter ability to hunt monsters inside the Gates (known mostly as dungeons) and mines the rare, magic-imbued materials within. Hence, 'hunters' and 'guilds' are established as part of the political balance. Sung Jin-Woo, dubbed by many as the World's Weakest Hunter, is an E-rank hunter with high tenacity to keep diving into near-death experience during hunting for the sake of his family. Comes his final hunt in unexpected double dungeon with death cannot be avoided, some sort of 'system' suddenly appear, giving him option to actually survive from the fatal attack. Since then, he takes the opportunity to learn about the system that only he can access and use it to level up his power, just as how the system is using him to make him stronger than average hunter's capability. Throughout his journey to power up, he overcomes each quest, penalty, enemy, ability limit while finding out the real objective of the system and Gates manifest on Earth.

*Opinion*: -
Tbh, i like both series equally since they are totally different. The only similarity I can see is the art style. Both are slow burn in term of progress from the beginning, but become stronger after 1/6 point and pretty consistent to the end. SL plot is mediocre thus easy to understand, whereas ORV plot is complex. SL has straightforward attack description of action that led immediate impact, whereas ORV has multiple attack engagements with world history-related that may require a bit of thinking before the impact of any action. SL gaming system is only applicable to MC that powers by an entity, whereas ORV apply streaming system to all characters powers by fable/story. SL reaches international popularity due to webtoon hype, whereas ORV has gained international high recognition with webnovel. However, I find myself able to engage more with ORV due to the characters and world-building, especially towards Kim Dokja. I resent and support him, happy and cry for him, empathize and sympathize with him, altogether at the same time. 1:06 is that girl in white with short hair, Han Sooyoung? The demon king of salvation is silently watching I highly recommend reading the novel, worth it 글로벌 우리장르 자랑스럽다 Just finished the novel and I feel SO DAMN SAD BEST WEBTOON!!!!!!!!!

I think that Han Sooyung and Kim Dokja is the canon ship here, there's this underlying meaning on how Sooyung would write a novel only for one person to read and that is Kim Dokja and Dokja even accepted Han Sooyung's proposal of reading her novel,  Dokja even suggested for its genre to be romance! ROMANCE!! With Kim Dokja even warning her that if he read her novel he might complain, that he's picky, that he would always bug her with comments and that it is possible that he would bug her for more chapters to which Han Sooyung is really glad since that's what Han Sooyung has been searching for.  Han Sooyung was jealous of tls123 (won't spoil who that is  but those who read until final will know ;3) because tls123 got Kim Dokja who would always comment on every single chapter and she really wanted someone like Kim Dokja too. "If this story can really save you..." "Then I'll keep writing the epilogue for you until the end of time, for eternity." THIS BASICALLY SHOWS THAT SHE IS WILLING TO GIVE HER ENTIRETY TO HIM FOR ALL ETERNITY. For the last chapters all she has been doing is writing all day and all night in hopes of saving Kim Dokja, she's willing to give her time for all eternity to Kim Dokja and she was the one who basically saved him. Han Sooyung literally saved him in more ways than one with even saving Kim Dokja before the start of everything, there is a paradox within this context ;3 Readers will know. Is it not obvious just how much Han Sooyung means to Kim Dokja and how much Kim Dokja means to Han Sooyung??? They are literally made for each other, the beginning and the end, from before everything started, how everything started, from the start, every moment and until the conclusion. Han Sooyung saved Kim Dokja and Kim Dokja saved Han Sooyung. Kim Dokja agreeing to be her reader means he would dedicate everything of him to her for all eternity, as Kim Dokja said, he is just a reader, and this really shows everything about him-he is a reader. By becoming Han Sooyung's reader, he's basically dedicating his entirety to her. AND they're both constellations, they can literally be with each other, FOREVER. Han Sooyung would write for Kim Dokja for all of eternity and Kim Dokja would dedicate all of himself as a reader for Han Sooyung for all of eternity. HONESTLY THEY'RE ABSOLUTELY PERFECT TOGETHER. ABSOLUTELY. IN THE LAST CHAPTERS EVEN IT WAS ALL BECAUSE OF HAN SOOYUNG'S LONGING FOR KIM DOKJA THAT THEY WERE ABLE TO SAVE KIM DOKJA WHICH WAS SUPPOSED TO BE IMPOSSIBLE. She dedicated dedicated her humanity to Kim Dokja, her everything to him and Kim Dokja also lived and was saved because of her, dedicating his all, being Han Sooyung's reader for all of eternity just for her. This is absolutely love, it may even be the truest love I've ever seen. They dedicate everything of themselves to each other, for all of their ■■ ETERNITY. [Constallation Endless has sponsored you 1000 coins] hey webtoon readers if u didn’t know, this is a novel adaptation so yeeeah read that too I don't know if anyone commented on this yet, but I'm liking the bits of animation in this trailer should i read the webnovel? i already read the raws and im so hypedd!! and does anyone know where to read the webnovel for free? Can't wait to see Yoo Sangah in black Chinese dress 😌👌 If this was an anime it would get anime of the year Vba anyone plz tell me who is thr Guy shown in 0:54 in this trailer I really wanna know This story is a ROLLERCOASTER of emotions ORV is one of the best LN I ever read 
So I'm sure it's going to be be a Amazing ride 
Oh 
I hope they don't make Dokja gay in this... [Viewers have sponsored all their coins] Yeah, the story better than solo lveling. Dokja is my favorite character i just started reading this at the very beginning of this month (may) ... and it’s become one of my ultimate favorites already! it’s so *MWAH!* Why'd it keep saying he's the only reader? He never thought that. He's just the only one to finish reading it. I'm up to volume 3 in the novel and I have to say this is one of the best stories I have read in a long time. You seriously wouldn't regret reading it. The way Dokja uses his knowledge of the story and adjusts to scenes he never expected are so impressive. Guys, do you know that dokja(독자) means reader in Korean? So the title of this novel is 'omniscient reader view point (전지적 독자 시점)' Will there be an anime? damn, this trailer is some another level shit I am just waiting for Biyuu.. Just finished reading the webnovel and I must say ORV was the best novel I've ever read in my whole life. I felt so empty alr and I don't usually reread a story but now I'd like to read it again. ORV made me appreciate reading a story to know diff POVs of the characters. I can't wait to read the upcoming chapters in webtoon too ❣️ I recommend this so badly its so good, read it i beg you you wont regret it
its a mix of fantasy, action and comedy <3 I thought webtoon doesn't allow blood scenes ? 우리 독자 너무 잘생겼지 않음 "There are three ways to survive the apocalypse. But that doesn't mean that only three people can survive." I hope webtoon version give this series a happy family side story.  OUR LOVELY SQUID DOKJA CONSTELLATIONS DESERVE ITTT 😭 MY DOKJAAAAAAAAAAAA <3 OH MY GOD YEEEESSSSSS 9/10 this series got me hooked ay the first episode it is amazing and how he usus his knowdlege 오.... 네이버 웹툰 영어판이 사이트가 있구나... 근데요???? 전부다 무료네?? 뭐지???? 김독자가 맛있고 중혁이가 만든 음식이 멋있는 그 웹툰...소설 Okay but was this inspired from the Japanese drama Alice In Borderland?
I have read the webtoon but the plot is same for both, survival games, its just AIB is more gore amd horror and this is, sci-fi.. Okay soo.... I calculated for how many years it will take for the manhwa to finish

There are a total of 551 chapters in the novel

1 week = 1 chapter
1 month = 4 chapters
1 year = 48 chapters



so 551 chapters / 48 chapters a year = 11.4791666667 years



(11 years x 365 days = 4015 total days to finish)

And I didn't include other variables that may affect the number of chapters made (eg. months of hiatus and that they'll shorten/cut some scenes from the novel so that they can catch up and won't take too long to be completed)

So maybe the estimated years to finish will be about 10-12 years at least because the artist needs to take hiatus to prepare for the next season and also if there's any accidents or health issues.

Damn that's long but I'll wait because I'm so excited to see it drawn. This novel is completely different from the rest, it is truly a whole new level of novel.  In the novel is full of elements and believe me, you won't be able to guess what will happen next.  And have you ever tried to imagine yourself in a series where you are not the main character?  And this series of novels will satisfy you. It is very worth to read it A few chapters in and I'm already going crazy. This is so damn good. Good doesn't even begin to explain how GOOD IT IS!!!!! Prepare your tissues in advance..... Thus, the ugliest king was born. I'm a new reader of the webtoon but I am curious as to why huiwon isn't famous among the characters. I mean I really love her character and I actually ship her with dokja😭am I the only one? BTW should I wait for the manhwa or should I read the novel? Like very much this serie ! ☺️ When you like this so much. It feels like you were became a certain constellation hungry for the story for this shit. Off IF THIS DOESN'T GET ANIMATED IN THE NEXT 2-3 YEARS OR SOMETHING, I SWEAR! I'M READY TO FIGHT! [Constellation Demon-Like Judge of Fire says she can share Dokja and Junghyuk's together moment with you] Merinding gila ngeliat trailernya :)) This story has a lot of ■■■. Our protagonist would get ■■■ and be ■■■. There are many fun characyers like YJH the ■■■ who is also ■■■. And an annoying character named H■■ who will be the protagonist's ■■■. Paradox among Paradox i.m.o I've been reading the novel,and it legitimately makes you cry at times....it's so good! its been a few months since ive read the novel and im still getting chills
i fking love this book *imagine if this gets an anime adaptation, would probably take the world by storm ✨👏🏻* Who are you?
I'm just a reader and I'm the only one who knows the end of this world I really hope this gets an anime or drama Guys ... How do you make such good content !! what the fuckkkk im so excited its been so long since ive finished the novel and ngl im still feeling empty whenever im missing dokja every now and then lmao imagine being so attached to a man who doesnt exist in your world line 🤡🤡 Oh, es sorprende el número de visitas del vídeo, ya entiendo porque es tan famoso en inglés. The 4687 dislikes are from SL simps :v Dokja: I'm just a reader
Me: That is what I'm going to say if every comic from webtoon or manga become real 0:53 why the heck she smiling at him
🔊Relationship Alert!!!!🔊 The light novel reader will be like Kim Dokja while talking to manhwa readers lolol What's the name of the song used in the trailer? ahhh goosebumps. 잘 만들었잖아 🥰 Esse manhwa é perfeito Aahhh kim dokja...  Uwaaaaahhhhhhhh This is way better than Solo Leveling. The only thing why Solo Leveling is so popular right now is because the art.The more I read this, the more it feels like one of those soulless cultivation Manhuas where the MC gets more and more OP and crushes his opposition easily with little effort. When I first started reading this, I thought there would be some depth to the story, given how the confrontation with the statues played out. But right now it's not anything like that. There doesn't seem to be any struggle or deep thoughts or philosophy in the story, just constant power ups. Except for the MC, all the other characters are very forgettable due to how one dimensional they are and it seems the MC is rapidly turning one dimensional and forgettable as well. It's almost impossible to be emotionally invested in this story, unlike in a good shounen like Naruto or One Piece. Solo Leveling didn’t even get popular until the mahwa come out and become a huge hit while ORV is already popular before the mahwa come out. That’s the different. i love the webtoon hopefully the anime is gonna be good I've just been simping on Kim Dokja and Jung Heewon all the time Finally Oh Kim Dokja... :( Fans of the Webtoon and Webnovel, there's an Omniscient Reader community on Amino, http://aminoapps.com/c/Omniscient_Reader_Amino 👌 one fact wrong. mc is not the only reader. but he is the only reader that finished reading it. Dokja is lowkey sung jin woo Probably the best book I've read. THE ANIMATION SO GOOD 

THE ANIMATION IS WAY BETTER THAN THE OTHERS

the webtoon is rlly gud

It’s my second fav ?????????/826만회??? 독시 뭐야 I hope will be different the ending in this manhwa, there's nothing good end if dokja die or didn't comeback 😭 Tem acessibilidade para eficiente Acessibilidade para deficiente visual I don't know how many times I've cried while reading the lightnovel of ORV. Damn self sacrificing squid... (ಥ﹏ಥ) 축하합니다! 당신은 수많은 영어댓글중 
한국댓글을 발견하셨습니다! 😭💕 best novel.... I love kdj.. Gosh, can't stop watching this WAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH I NEEEDSSS SOOYOUNGGH I wanna see this become an anime 😭, if it's not i'll crying as hell 😭😭 *1:04* as a novel reader I really like how the gang is here together TvT 

  I miss them... Omg I've been seeing this all over AO3!!! I thought it was a novel!! 😍😍😍 Yassss new webtoon to binge read!! Imagine if this became an anime!
Because some webtoons like Tower of God became animes,
That'd be epic! Only can read like 38 chapters If this would get an anime adaptation I think A.C.E.'s Goblin would be great to have as its opening song i still come back here and i seriously can Not get over how well-made they did this AS THEY SHOULD. this is literally one of the most popular webnovels in korea and the trailer just made it so much better😭😭 good luck to all webtoon dokjas cuz this will be a one hell of a ride Say this and was like wow how many chapters is the manga guy?? I just finished the novel last night and I was beyond speechless. First, the ending. I don't know how to say it but it's satisfying not (you know what I mean?) *I highly recommend you (whoever read this comment) to binge and read the novel and manhwa.. I don't want to put some spoilers in this so just read it.

Second is the characters.. they were well-made. Periodt.(I mean, do I need to explain it? Just read it!) Third is the FCKING TWISTS that got me utterly speechless. From HSY being the ___ and YJH being the ___ and of course KDJ being the ___. Heh.





Man. What a journey😊😄😆 Kim Dokja world domination Yea the story is good. He have to save the world that the book protagonist need a couple thousand tries need. Very very tense because we don't know what happened if the book protagonist died so MC has to think of a way to save his and someone else's ass. Also book protagonist have a depression. i've been watching this countless times, can't wait for the anime to exist If it were an anime then, it would probably be a global hit!! ✨💫

It should’ve in anime not comics 🤧🤧

Maybe after the comics there will be anime... 

Bcoz most of the anime often comes from the manga or comics!! this is so epic... if this is a real movie i will go to the cinema in this pandemic BEST.STORY.EVER!!! This should really get an anime, just like how solo levelling is getting one Just finished the light novel and 😭😭😭😭😭👌👌👌 Reader (Dok-ja) x Writer (Soo-Young) ftw!? The best novel I have ever read guys you have to read it When aired? *Knock*


Me: *cries heavily* DOKJAAAAAAA Me: *breath in, breath out*

*Chills sink in* Loveeeeeeee ohh my goddd I love this Webnovel/Manhwa so much- Dokja really out here being a conman during the Apocalypse Correct me if I'm wrong. I read somewhere that they'll make 5 movies. 
Is it true? THIS IS SO COOL!! Can anyone answer me-
 is the original Web Fiction(or is it called Light Novel in English? I honestly don't know for sure) translated into English officially? 

 Because I didn't know that Omniscient Reader had this much Non-Korean reader/fans. SO GOOD My constellation is Elon Muskalorian. He's not the only reader. probably my fav manga rn :D Best manhwa better than Solo leveling I swear Hyper Reality Show by Utsu-P would be a good op for this imo. I just finished the novel! Looking forward to the manga update! This is my favourite webtoon This trailer is so good. I just got goosebumps. *looks at  manhwa-only readers*

*craughing in epilogue* Me in class when I’m the only one who did the reading 😂 In short : how to sacrifice yourself 외국어? Han SooYoung only show her back but i love her already If you're thinking of reading this, stop thinking and go read this. It's awesome and you're not gonna regret it. The King of Demon Salvation 🔥 poem reader Can you make it an anime? Fuckin crazy i love dokja. I hope everyone enjoy this novel and weptoon. ㅠㅠ Best art I've ever seen in my life.


..and the story!!!!!! Been reading since the start this is going to be damn epic, i can't wait WTF THIS IS GETTING ANIMATED SOON HAVE YOU SEEN THE NEWS AAAAAAAAAAAAAAA I WAS WAITING SINCE FOREVER AAAAAA THE FANTASTIC NOVEL I READ BEFORE US NOW GETTING ANIMATED HUHUHU CHSKDVAOBD ㅋㅋㅋ800만회 미쳤어요~~!!전독시 많이들 파주세요 후회 안하실 거라고 장담합니다. bro i never get tired watching this trailer 😂 This looks so good because it’s like he was teleported into the world of the series, which is my favorite genre! (Isekai is the name of the genre) So going to read this!! What is with the dislikes??? You guys cannot tell me that the mc from omniscent reader doesn't look like the young distant cousin of the mc from solo levelling. Nobody can change my mind👁👄👁 this is the type of comic that keeps u on ur toes and makes u fall flat on ur face for the MC. I don't regret it This deserves a full fledged anime edition. I cannot get enough. My mind has been blown and the art is STRIKINGLY GORGEOUS ｡ﾟ(TヮT)ﾟ｡ cannot wait for more updates ❤️ Constellation "lazy webers" smiles!! Man's hacking irl This is better than Solo Leveling. IT HITS IN KOREA SO HARD. Always #1 . This aint a adult manhwa? No gonna lie I got some chill when he said he can change the ending. Ouf this manhwa is crazy one of the best thing about this novel is that it indicates this story being passed to sing N song (the real author of this webtoon) by the op of this story which actually leaves you in the edge with this strong feeling of the apocalypse being real, that this whole webtoon is a real happening and one of us could be mc's reincarnation 존나 좋쿤
Fuckin yeah!! About time it seems the best novel in history came with a webnovel hell yeah Eu decido ver do que é o manhwa aí vejo isso It looks like a real anime intro HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAA [Demon-like Judge of Fire] love your comradeship. 500 coins has been sponsored. cant wait for King of a Kingless World arc and every arc after that lmao








also, sooyoung dokja 😳 와 조회수 미쳤네 가슴이 웅장해진다 giving me the SWEET HOME vibes No at first i thought it was good, but i was wrong. IT IS THE BEST Still can’t believe Kaidou gave into the dark reunion. I hope Crunchyroll will make this an anime😁. Anyone Please tell me Kim Dokja is a gay or not...I hope no [ Three Ways To Survive In Ruined World]
 
But only one thing is certain that,
I Will Survive I love this webtoon so much I'm think that this incredible webtoon should have an anime abii nerden izlerim bunu yardım edin mangasını okuyorum şu an The best part about this webtoon is that everyone thinks Dokja is gay Love this webtoon! Aha the most ancient dream The webnovel of this is one of the best things I've ever read, it was simply amazing for me. 전독시는 어디에서나 전설이다 This webtoon is the perfect example of 2020🤣🤣 Reasons why this is a must-read webtoon:-
The entire freaking plot is so badass that you won't be able to handle it. 😁
MC (Dokja) is the most savage protagonist you ever gonna meet. 😇
Tons of other reasons are there too but my hands ache from typing. But I promise you, you won't ever regret clicking. "Fight like a reader"~Dokja Omnisient Reader is very different from some other manhwas or novels like every boys admire mc and every girls fall in love to mc. Every side characters have their own story and own development. 
Their are many genres in this story... fantasy, apocalypes, comedy, survival, tragedy, action and even little bromance just for humor. Omnisient Reader's mc is not overpowered character. His only adventage is that he knows all the original story. So he has to solve the difficult situation just with his knowledge. However, he tries to change the story since the original story is full of tragedy and failness. And this makes really interesting story. 
I highly recommand to read this, both the webtoon and the novel. It's plot is awesome and all characters are great. The novel's English translation is quite awful... but it's okay to read it. I read this on another site and I honestly just can’t wait for more. Be aware of the king of ugly he will speed run this apocalypse with a simple Novel when MC isn't the MC. WHAT THE HELL?! Bruhh... I already read this but😑 this is my first time watching this so its giving me a goosebumps😱☺️
hahhahahahha😁 So, when are you gonna do a trailer for eleceed?? I just hope there will be no romance in this Our Kim Dokja is so handsome~ SPOILER!









This trailer... The last panel... Is that the 99th scenario? The ARK?! Ĺitttt Ive been thinking abt this for some time now, to novel readers:



















Aren't we all The Most Ancient Dream, rather than a constelation? Since HSY basically wrote orv and the ending of the epilouge was left to be ambigious, leaving us to use our own imagination on what we think the ending is, basically 'dreaming' about it Well turns out he isn’t the only reader lol 0:59 peak homoerotic tension Now this is a webtoon worth reading!! Who knows, one out millions of novels, mangas, etc can most likely become reality especially the apocalypse.
Love this story!! Hope this series is a  long one. 
Reading is powerful and knowledgeable!! 조회수 뭐임..? Sunfish Man this trailer really makes it look like its an actual anime show and not a webcomic 1:03 I'm Dokja.
It's so good to see this animated trailer. I'm looking forward to the illustrated chapters!

The novel is a gem, a must read. Spoiler Alert!! But its a meme







Readers: so how many times will you let kim dokja be killed?
Author: yes Dude I just found this as my first ever webtoon read. And now I am spending coins and reading the novel wow- And thats why ladies and gentlemen, you should read at least one apocalypse story in your life.. *Omniscient Reader’s Viewpoint is an absolute Masterpiece* mark my words. What if I’m the reader of WEBTOON, can I be the protagonist of the story and change the ending just like him? 800만ㄷㄷ Is this boys love story? Am I ready to feel the pain once again?




Y E S. This trailer got so many views because of the web novel Masterpiece. Constellation 'Demon-like Judge of Fire' is recommended this story to everyone ♥ I say that crunchyroll makes this an anime like and comment if you agree *THIS IS A MUST TO READ*
This is one of the biggest fantasy novels in Korea, it's very famous. I promise you it's worth reading. These are web novels I really enjoyed reading:

-Omniscent reader
-S classes that I raised
-Trash of the count family
-Solo Leveling

The first 3 are REALLY famous, I mean *EXTREMELY* famous. Those 3 are considered the BIG 3 within the fantasy/action web novels. Solo leveling was known quite well by people but not as much as the other 3, but it got famous after the webtoon got released because the quality of the webtoon was amazing! Anyways, out of the BIG 3, 'Omniscient reader' and 'Trash of the count family' got a webtoon released but 'S classes that I raised' is the only one that does not have a webtoon adaptation...but I hope they'll release one soon! I love it so much, it's fun!  I already like things like this, I think you will definitely like it even though I have finished reading the novel many times, but I will wait and see the manga!  It must be fun and I will pay!! //i​ love​ dokja This story deserves a anime . I recommend this story . It too good UGLIEST KING Waiting for the theater Scene to be Drawn 🙏😂 Everyone if liking this, even me. It has a LOT of potencial. The webtoon just have 16 chapters and everyone is already saying how epic is this. Even the not-Novel readers.
I just came to re watch the trailer to peek some future plot I literally cried for an hour or so from happiness when I heard there would be a manghwa about Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint. (っ˘̩╭╮˘̩)っ will the novel be published? Awesome มีคนไทยไหมเอ๋ย hello
im just finish reading the webnovel. on the first i knew this novel because of manhwa but the story get intrigue me in some point to know more then it takes me to the novel. at first i read it to know what happen next after chapter 25 and then more i read more i want to know what next what next and hella im in the roller coaster  riding in the story. it takes me a week to finish this until the end. my point of view on this story is definitely be part of my life. the emotions with the story with the comrade go through each scenario because this story not only talk about mc but whole of his comrade/companion/friends with so much love.. Please do your best to make this a anime I have been loving it so far This, this book is one of the best book I have ever read. So intense and full of secret plots and plot reveal. Just love it. I remember reading this from rainbowturtle's site omggggg *for anyone who just arrived, I think this can be count as spoiler sooo*

I'm just finished reading the novel this week and.. God. 

I can't help it but love and hate the epilogue. One way, I feel like the ending was just so "ORV" that you can make up whatever you want from the ambiguous ending but then again I just really want one or two chapter where everything's finally.. Okay? 

Well idk but I need to see hanyookim talked and a bit pieces about how everyone is after our dear Reader finally, finally coming home Yo amo esta novela es mi favorita!!~💖 ya voy por la mitad de la novela ojalá continúen los capítulos del manhua Damn why isn’t this an anime already? Why tf are there so many dislikes?! Omniscient Readers is amazing (Currently on Chapter 384)
But I would love it if someone made this a game just imagine.
Playing Scenarios with your friends and getting skills and weapons.
Having Open World and maybe even a plaza once you reach a certain scenario.
Gaining stories from online event scenarios and using them to boost your attributes and play style.
Deciding your play style ex.
Swordmaster-More sword skills and a boost to sword skills and attributes
 Prophet-Able to see someone skills and attributes during battles, and a skill to dodge an attack.
Monster-
Archer-
Healer-
Tanker-
Monster Tamer-
etc.
Grind to become a constellation, Demon King, Outer God, or Archangel. (kinda like the legend grind in 2k.) By obtaining high-level stories and participating in events.
Traveling to different worlds and exploration.
Character Design.


I think this would be amazing especially with next-gen consoles or if it was just pc only because of the graphical capabilities, and I really enjoyed the manga so I think if someone made it a game it would be amazing. 神作
不接受反駁 Im just waiting for a anime of this [Constellation, Demon-like Judge of Fire says in advance that the small figurines of Kim Dokja is not for sale] I believe in Yoo Jonghyuk supremacy Ahhh I want to read this... ok bye ima go read it ORV >>>>> Solo Leveling I'm reading the web novel currently, and this is the best thing I've ever read. everything is so well written, all the ending parts are cliffhangers and sentences that will drive you mad(because they are so good), i love all the characters and their comradeship. If you aren't reading the web novel you are missing so much THE BEST! -but today fiction became reality-
I wish🥺 오우 맨 YEESSSSS OMG WEBNOVEL READERS WHERE U AT??? This trailer and the plot is great and I love it, imma read it

Edited: Jusr finished reading 25chapter/episodes its one of a heck story one should read. Wish for an anime adaptation based on this 😭❤️❤️ The novel was amazing Should I read the novel or webtoon first Can someone please explain to me what is all this apocalypse about? Finally GREAT STORY LINE WEBTOON SUCCESS 3000 This would make a great anime trailer Alguien más vino por qué le salió mientras veia algo más y estaba tan buena la trama que quedastes atrapado ...pues ami me pasó y se me olvidó el otro video que estaba viendo.. since the novel has over 500 chapters i wonder how many the webtoon will have 🥰. i’ve already used all my coins on this help *Hey Crunchyroll, I need to report you a webtoon/novel to animate...* i reading it, and i'm  fucking exited for the next chapiters You need to read this if you haven’t already Is it gonna turn into an anime I'm so happy this is getting a live action and anime for short, it's going to be a franchise! This novel deserves it after all. The story is really a masterpiece. Imagine this webtoon specifically coming to life the first time you take the subway. Can somebody please tell me the name of the software used to create this intro? Please. Can I just say I love the main character in this story he literally could of saved everyone in the cabin but instead he killed all the eggs on his own so he could kill one guy he didn’t like This is not a yaoi right? Are they planning on putting 551 episodes in to this, because I’ve read the the first few and I need this in my life! I haven’t read the novel but I really hope this web tune will end up being super long Let's make this highest liked Webtoon video in Webtoon channel I’m reading this and the last episode we have to wait for 48 days what the fujsiskxkslakz I’m just kidding but it does take 48 days in order to read the last episode because it takes long to make a WEBTOON so I understand I already finished reading the whole 551 webnovel chapters. What a ride.
There were some points where I thought "this is getting repetitive that it's cliche/ cheesy/ cringe" and I considered to drop it, several times.
But I continue reading, just like how Kim Dokja faithfully reads Ways of Survival, and I gradually fell in love with it. The unique plot, the characters, I love how well written they are.
Also the ending really got my heart, a very proper one imo.
Definitely recommend it to anyone who read this comment.
Yes, to you the Reader, just as I am a Reader too For reference, it is said that this webtoon is preparing to produce about hundreds of animations scheduled to be produced in 5 movies and drama 5 seasons. Common guys u got goosebumps while watching this didn't u~~
Well atleast I did I have been reading the novel for 3 days straight and its damn good. Currently on chapter 313. omniscient reader's viewpoint:551
Omniscient reader's viewpoint if his dad wasn't abusive: 0 aaaa i can’t wait to see how the future events in the novel will actually look! THIS NEEDS TO BE ANIME Looks solid af , i will give it a chance *Constellation "The Watcher of light and darkness" is smiling at you* OMG all of the main characters are in this scene 1:06 Omg dude i was here when the trailer was just out and it already has 8 million viewers less than a month that's awesome this webtoon is literally something it's truly deserves it !!! WHEN IS THE ANIME VERSION COMING OUT?? I would love to see this as a anime I underestimated the power of this webtoon! Now I am hooked to it!😍 Hm~ another one was added to the list. Now I'll just wait for a "Reincarnator" adaptation. Sobs. Good story *And I was quietly staring at that scene.* Happy 8 million views! （＾◇＾） I AM ALREADY READING THIS WEBTOON AND I HADN'T SEEN IT'S TRAILER YET....THE TRAILER IS EVEN MORE FREAKING AWESOME THAN THE WEBTOON!!!!! This is gonna be the next solo leveling and when it does I'm gonna be the one of the few people to say that I was part of the OG fam. 
Note: part of the OG manhwa fan btw. I haven't read the novel since I'm a kid so I can't pay for the chapters 😞😞 THAT trailer give me goosebumps... [The constellation Demon King of Salvation sponsored 60,000 coins] And this, kids, is why you should read books. So they finally made it into webtoon This is Gay One of the best things is that the MC won’t be in a romantic relationship, so the shippers can go crazy. But, not having romance also is one of the best thing about it. The novel is a masterpiece. Webtoon had just came out a month or so ago, and I’m here anticipating for an anime to be made. I very much expected there to be one after the Webtoon. But I know making Webtoon and animes are hard work, so I will wait patiently.

Edit:
Actually, now that they had decided to have Omniscient Reader, will they also translate the manhua/webtoon for The Trash of the Count’s Family? I really hope they do.  I know that there’s a Korean manhua/webtoon, but I don’t know Korean...I hope they will have it on Webtoon. But then, the novel is incomplete right now, and I think Webtoon only picks up completed novels? 
Okay, I’m just going to wait and hope. Where can i read this besides webtoon Author-nim: So how many times are you going to die?



Kim Dokja: Yes. As a reader of the light novel I will only say one thing:
the story of Omniscient Reader Viewpoint is a paradox, at some point I was asking a question similar to "is the egg born before the chicken, or is the chicken born before the egg" It's hereeeeeeeeeeeeeee! Finally can't wait until the comics go with 100+ chaps. It'd be epic. Would you like to use the stigma [Regression]? *THE ABSOLUTE MAJORITY OF CONSTELLATIONS IN THE CHANNEL ARE FEELING IMMENSE JOY*
.
.
.
.
*THE CONSTELLATION ‘PRISONER OF THE GOLDEN HEADBAND’ IS PULLING OUT HIS HAIR IN EXCITEMENT* That dude needs to get a hair cut smh Spoilers!






Sun Wukong too OP
Jokes(?) aside, the art seems good. So the anime adaptation comes out when? This man looks a lot like Jin Woo and his scenario is also very similar 🤔😂 Highly Recommend you read the light novel that the webtoon is based on. I’m pretty sure it’s completed too 👍👍👍 Endgame and Infinity War are trembling Kim dokja you fucking bastard 😂😂 literally this is the best novel I've ever read, I was overwhelmed for weeks when I finished, you can't predict anything, the characters developement, everything is insane 💕✔️ This is exactly what I wished whenever I finished reading a novel. I wanted to enter the world of a story😂. For example, I imagined myself as a wizard in the Wizarding World of Harry Potter hahaha. This trailer is, in my opinion, not good. No, I don’t wish to back that up with observations, or facts. I simply had a negative reaction to it, and it made me want to pass on what could easily be a good piece of media. The trailer is epic it's like an animation movie 🤩 It says from the studio that brought you solo leveling but webtoon doesn’t have solo leveling 🤔 I put my high hope that in the coming future, this will become a series episodes! I would definitely watch it no matter what. The animation were so amazing. When i red the first chapter, i've never been such so automatically amazed by it because i can usually sense that this is a spectacular storyline unlike any other comics that takes few chapter that pirques my interest. This comic is on another level! Must recommend for anyone out there who haven't read this yet. A huge regards to the author Ugh, as a reader of the novel, I'm speachless. Dont let me down please. I found out about the novel because of the webtoon. I thought it was gonna be just another no brainer read to pass boredom and I couldn't fathom why 551 chapters long?!...

200 chapters in and I was still invested.
300 chapters in and I WAS CRYING.
400 chapters in and I'M FREAKING WAILING.

A MUST read with a steady plot, great plot twists and very loveable and round characters. I'm so excited for the webtoon!! Y U R I S OR B L S PLEASE Imagine if they made this into an anime I’m reading this at night Can ANYONE explain to me how this has so many dislikes? Any drama going on? OR is pretty much one of the best novels and webtoons of this type with decent amount of chapters right now, so why? I wont be suprised if crunchyroll turns this into an anime too once it gets enough episodes.
I mean, this trailer had really good quality AND ANIMATION!
But for now lets focus on the comic and novel, shall we? Ew weeb stuff [Constellation 'Demon king of Salvation' sponsors 20,000 coins] I downloaded webtoon for this. this should be an anime I hope this is how they animate the whole series of they make a animated version It's actually really good I invested into reading this all night l ITS GETTING SO MUCH VIEWS IM CRYIINNGGG This story looks like it will get animated, and if yes I couldn't be more happier wtf is even going on here with the random ass body shots Just knowing what’s going to happen already changes the future, not by much, but it still changes it I think he and the novel's mc will clash This webtoon is incredible and the webnovel too! Solo Leveling ? I don't think I've seen a single webtoon that's been completed.

I know there are. But I can't find them. 7.2MILLION VIEWS HOLY SHIT MY FAV NOVEL IS FINALLY GETTING THE RECOGNITION IT DESERVES La coutoisie est l'une des premières règles de convivialité . but i’m just a reader, an omniscient reader! (in matpat’s voice) Wow! I have no idea what this is but I do know it’s truth in plain sight!!! Evil force thinks it’s the only reader of reality! Don’t be deceived. Evil will not win. Pray for discernment. Billy Bob will have a better ending.

https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=UAywHtqRRgg I love this novel.. I was so happy it got a webtoon This guys dies like... a lot I already have a back log. I don’t need more stuff to read!

The creator is a genius Nói Hoài cũng vậy chi cho mệt cho là cho không cho là không cho vậy thôi quên lãng nó đi đừng nghĩ đến mới có vvvvvv Whatever your heart desires🌠🔥 I knew people were gonna underestimate this Webtoon, y’all really need to read it’s so goooood Need to check out my YouTube.  RICH HAMM .  The same picture had my profile picture. Could I just say that the art style seems a bit similar to solo leveling? Eh...I'll wait for the anime to come out **me trying to understand the comments** I just started reading this 2 days ago on webtoon and it is one of the best i have read yet YOOOO THIS WEBTOON IS HEAT I READ IT WHEN IT RELEASED ITS FIRST 3 EPISODES AND IM HOOKED Solo leveling ?😭 I can recommend “WaterMelon” and “Mage and Demon Queen” NO THX I love omniscient reader It’s a really good manhwa Ima binge read this now Ohmaga w d I love this story tho! It's so awesome F E ANIME 🤢 😵 I hope it’s not me being fish stick and I’ll be crying and sad Door stopper. The with of .The door that goes under the Door? 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 Welcome 'Would make a great anime. This gives me solo levelling vibes... Jesus is at the door, Rapture is near! Thank god it is still in my planned list now I can watch this anime without spoilers ♥️ Its a must read I It loooksssssss sssssssssooooooo cool I wanna read some webtoon now. The webtoon is good however you guys should try the webnovel version 
In my opinion I prefer the webnovel Not for an old fart like me. You can keep your Apocalypse. I read a little i didn't like it I found it to scary for me i don't like scary Oh boy, OH BOY! The trailer looks fantastic!!

Also you will be hearing "Who are you" a lot within this Webtoon 😂 I accidentally clicked this lmao Love it Lo malo está en inglés :'v y el español todavía no lo saca I'm all over this already!!! Wow such fake comments 10/10 This is epic no joke, I saw the beginning of the ad without context and thought it was another political advertisement GAY AF. Where the regular cartoons at?? I love this Webtoon😍 Anyone who's on the fence about reading it, then let me just say, "Dew it!" I wish I could change if this is an advertisement or not. Heads up, the LN version is out there too. :> promise u guys. this is really good. I recommend this webtoon 100% to everyone who hasn’t read it yet. It’s amazing Must read. .. Old school rap And this is why kids, you read books Not enough chapters only 20 ill wait till about 100 They should make this a show They should make this into an anime This is an impressive trailer I'm in the middle of this series Dissemination of the mission in underground literature, abd dies become reality that the protesters galvanized in literature. You get my gist. THE "MAIN EVENT"....🤣🐸🎶👣🙌OMGOD🙏🤣
AM I...🤣😰 This seems like an awesome idea. I haven't checked it out, but it is an awesome idea. 
In addition, literature that precedes reality is nothing new. If you will, Revolutions can begin in underground settings, with secret meetings and literature dissemination. Lots of it. Revolutions then manifest into cultural and political upheaval, more than a coup...Well, maybe size or dimensions doesn't ameays matter. A coup d'etat or a Revolution from those who suffer oppression and ruling class dictatorship begin in many cases in history with rhetoric and a heavy emphasis of dissemination of I'm going to cry if the child with the crickets ends up dead Imagine after finishing the manhwa the apocalypse begins... FEEEEELS SOOOOO FAMI*LIAR
OOOOOOH GOD 🤕👣💞🙏😭😰👽🐸HELP ME*HELP*"US"🐸😇 Fuck this coin system bs. This is a great series so far but LINEs greed is just too much. I don't mind paying a subscription fee but to try and nickel and dime people is the type of greed that creates an ActiBlizz or EA. In 10 years I’m gonna look back on this and be like:I wonder if omniscient reader is still going on This can make a good anime Anyone else get solo leveling vibes or just ne 7 Who sees the predictive programming in this The trailer for this just made it ten times cooler for me Saludos desde Tulsa Olahoma Damn I thought it was anime hahahha gomen gomen but i will read it anyway Wish you could not.get a thumbs down for being a ad He looks like sung jin woo :o Legit good. I've read the novel and seeing the webtoon and this trailer.. I  love it! Anime adaptation is a must! The story is well written and just amazing. I highly recommend the novel. The webtoon adaptation makes me wanna cry seeing their characters come to life once more in another form of art. Keep up with showing us amazing stories turn into webtoons. :) I remember reading this on the  webnovel site. The MC (or viewpoint character if you will) could not stop mentioning how he was the only one to read a certain book to the end. Could have made a drinking game out of it. Now, it's a webtoon? Let's see if they kept that aspect or toned it down. Too late, the damage is done. I like spoilers This is such a good one oh? No sorry I don’t watch cartoons Dude there’s no way I’m gonna buy coins from your app even if this is on there.... no YES IT'S HERE I can change the ending... for the right one... I DON'T LIKE THIS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I WILL NOT WISH I COULD CHANGE THE END!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
STOP SHOWING ME THIS AD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! لمعرفت من زار برفايلك زور الموقع على جوجل في اول رابط بس عليك تكتب في جوجل vad5as Ah yes, a webtoon with MC and a Protagonist. Must read this. Katy perry wants to travel ✈️ https://youtu.be/IGTaiTVXF4w Whitney hi Whitney No Doubt Hell ya anybody that is reading this comment I can  guarantee that u will be ENTERTAINED. ARE U NOT ENTERTAINED Me reading the Bible on new year's eve

2020: it was at that moment that the book i was reading came to life💀 This webtoon is a must read. A MUST READ I SAID! The world building, the characters development, and the plot is so good. The realistic take on the apocalypse don't hide anything. Good things, bad things, truths that are usually censored, everything. If you have the time, go read the webnovel as well. Like seriously, go read it. You won't regret it. (Prepare your tissues. Trust me, you're gonna need it later on.) 

Also, can't wait to finally see *the* black flame dragon ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) YUS MY ONLY WISH IN LIFE ME AND MC HAVE SO MUCH IN COMMON ALREADY TO ESCAPE THIS BORING LIE I GO TO AMAZING NOVELS AND COMICS AND MANGAS I guess we can have hector take the place to since wasn’t to up close in some ways lol Yeah I wish I could change the ending for erased anime adaptation..? please Denise McNeff is not welcome on my YouTube feed, fix please? Though I thought this story would be 3rd person breaking the 4th wall by the first chapter, (it isn’t that Btw), but it is still a very good read. 
It gives me no game no life, hunger games, and (the concept of what sao was supposeD to be) vibes, possibly combating Nier Automata with the main characters knowledge and internal to external conflict. 
I’m glad I’m starting to find some good novels to read and look forward to through these trying times! 
Stay safe everyone! i LOVE this!!!! For some reason, this manga gives me solo leveling art vibe. Bruh, my boy Kim Dokja is sexy AF. Anyone who says either wise is mentally impaired or has profanity filters in their eyes because of how hot my dude is. Why am i being advertised this garbage and smut e.e When ya Learn You won’t be saying I’m hungry I’m hungry lol yes life is a long journey either ya learn or ya never learn this red hair costed me 100 million alright Paul McCartney hand it’s to me as a friend As Christ's return draws closer as it was written in the  captions of this anime "Fiction will become reality" Roses are red
Your family left you
Anime sucks
And so do you Zzz I ended it The OC becomes the Self Insert Reader! It kind of makes me think Good Omens with the whole book predicting the apocalypse thing. Sounds cool! Stop No who else has been waiting fro a webtoon story like this? If ya learn ur lesson than ya quit whining till the end of journey ya learn something new ya make it somewhere out there Honestly the story sucks the concept is bad OH I READ THIS IT IS SO FRICKING COOL LOL but kinda scary Make this into a anime Can you show me how to get the top off the battery on a GMC *cracks knuckles * _im still reading this on mangago until the webtoon catches up sorry_ But did no one think to ask not only how there was only one reader but also why the author didn’t just move platforms at any point during 10 years of only 1 view for all 3100+ chapters? The author has to be either the villain or obsessed with the protag Wait I was reading this on tachi Stg this is an anime trailer at this point I read one piece for 15 years, if we get isekai to that world I doubt my knowledge would do anything. This series is amaxinh 0:03  This reminded me of it has begun by Starset Google: we have the best ads (are stalkers)
Webtoon: Hold my beer This needs to be an anime woah this looks epic :0 Dr 3x How did I not know of webtoons trailers I HAVE BEEN READING ON IT FOR YEARS HOW HAVE I NOT KNOW AHH. and this one looks really good so I'ma go sub to this comic real fast so bye THIS TRAILER IS SO GOOOOOD! anti anime has join the chat You must include for those who are blind or visually impaired this was totally all action and great music but no verbal content for those of us who enjoy descriptive audio. Think of the sensitivity to all persons who enjoy movies it’s an option you can add! Americans disability associates I am a professional vision rehabilitation therapist who just so happens to be blind. Yo pensè que Jorge Sonnante hablarìa mas, por que èl sabe mas. En cambio el entrevistador no lo deja expresarse. Entonces para que lo invitò? Mala entrevista! when you started reading the webcomic before the webtoon ads show XD Looks good but not cool with died bodys 0:34 It’s really good 😌 Plot Twist: The reader has schizophrenia. Intense..... I like it And when WEBTOON have this but not solo :) AYO WTF THIS SHIT GOT ME HYPED thought this was solo leveling at first whenever someone asks for a good Webtoon to read i recommend them this one bc it barely came out but has so much plot and in my opinion i love it in every aspect. sorry for the long comment i just love omniscient reader :p https://youtu.be/Ta6bhU5idF4 👇🏻Want tog back I'm trying to answer those very questions and now because I am a reader I see what's on the face of the skin and what is under that skin I know the blood that spilled is the tattoos I know the ash that falls makes the pictures and ask for the photograph I said photographs all it takes is a bright light and a mirror and chlorophyll and all those are on the planet and by planet I mean this fucking continent is somebody better God damn talk to me soon Redice prob the best Webtoon artist/illustration studio. Brought us Solo Leveling, Tomb Raider King, and now this. As well as a few others. What is this, some kinda movie?




Get it, because of the music and sound effects..... I want an anime of this after it finishes. Evil, evil this deserves a whole anime. I knew it Same studio that does Solo Leveling
Me: *You have my attention* This is so clean So is it gonna be a grimdark slog or a power wank I love this so much Is it possible to get so hyped at a manhwa you're already reading? Yeah so like...I read the 50 chapters of the novel Please correct me if I’m wrong, but did anyone else feel like this is a rip-off of solo-leveling? Bro this webtoon is same as solo leveling that we all love but the only difference is-
Solo leveling: Mc don't know that his power is
Ominicent: Mc knows the power. Este es el man que se leyó una novela de 3000 cap. Oh algo así(? 
Ya lo he leído. Bueno, solo leí unos cuantos capítulos. Es muy bueno. 
Y dicen que la novela es buenísima. Solo leveling has epic fights, this has that x100 and a better story. Also no matter what anyone says Dokja and Jung-Hyeok are not gay, thats just the weird ass fantasies of people who like boy love. This should be an anime Releasing on 2030 Constellation 'Op Author' has taken a interest in you ... 
Mc : hmmm... 😕🙄
Author : Gifting mc with full story package giving insane cheats 
Mc : y u giving me cheat u already have a isekai type reincarnated hero who is op as hell
Author : cuz I'm Author..!!! Don't question me!!!! 

In all fairness this is bombass webtoon and it's a must read if ur a solo leveling fan.. 😃 I'm on chapter 200 Professional Writer "Naoki Urusawa" Laughs at Omniscient Gamer Pandering's Trash Point. Re:Dice Studio back at it again milking the living fuck out of Gamer Pandering Stories with zero plot quality. can already imagine scene:
"Kimi wa.. dare?" 
"Ore wa reader da." Too bad the manhwa was still at chapter 16 The MC looks a lot like sung Jin woo from solo leveling I haven't read the comic but the novel truly is good. The protagonist is aware that his the protagonist!!, I have the novel in my library for awhile now but I haven't started reading it yet... Guess this is a sign already It would be pretty epic if this gets adapted into an anime After reading the 7th chap from manwha, I couldn't contain myself. so, I for the first time in my life started reading novel. And guess what? I'd never this decision of mine. This webtoon is seriously good but horribly short, I used to follow it before it got on webtoon and on webtoon, it is a couple chapters behind. This is so good on god The artwork /char looks rly similar to solo leveling at first 😅 is it gay tho ? This should become an anime. If Tower of God bacame one, why not this? :) Anime And Manga Is Getting Destroyed By Manhwa And I love it 
Because I'm an Manga Reader I only watch few anime ARISE MANHWA Brought a whole new level to the world of si-oc, huh YUSSSS IM SCREAMING hope it gets adapted into an anime, and good animation The character looks like the one at the solo levelling I'm not really a fan of novel but I'm so curious what's the next chapter was, so i read the novel and i can't stop reading it, i started last day and im on chap 368 now, you should read this webtoon/novel
HIGHLY RECOMMENDED! When is it being released as an anime? I HAVE NEVER BEEN HYPED TO A TRAILER. THIS IS A MUST READ!!!!!!! Seriously this manhwa not best because the plot is so stupid even cannot fight a story of solo leveling 흠.....이거 한글로 번역하면 전지적 독자?
주인공 이름이 김독자이긴 하지만 역시 외국인들이 이 뜻을 알아먹지 못할 거니까 걍 Reader 로 해버렸네 Fire. I’m already reading this and I’m in the 22th episode and it’s really amazing #the mc is op🙂 Omg the art is so beautiful Welp see you in 65 years and 5months This is exactly how One can Read Revelation but can't change it. Lister.... I've never had a "Charecter" that I was obssesed over with. BUT AFTER READIG THE LIGHT NOVEL...... KIM DOKJA IS IN MY  "OBSSESIVE" Charectar list...he is just..... Just read the light novel.you will know why I am. And maybe you will be too I'm on ch 265 snot is literally coming out of my nose rn when I saw the ending of this video I'm crying. I normally can't even read one page of a novel but this is so good 👌 I'm done reading the novel hihi this is good, I recommend it IT'S HERE OMG Hehehehehehh i read the novel and its lit and full of bromance like you cannot believe HAHAHAH UnOriginal IS DA FREAKING BEST NOW IF YOU EXCUSE ME IMMA READ IT The trailer looks as good as the webtoon is ❤️ There's a proverb in my country saying,"Reading is the window of the world." Now I know what that means. SPOILER




coulson you meet your match
If you watch agents of shield you  understand what I mean 😌 Didn't look into this for a while bc I usually hate isekai stuff, but after starting the webtoon I was hooked. Ended up reading the webnovel too, now I'm already 300 chapters in and it's only been three days. It's really well written and nearly every character gets their own development, the worldbuilding is amazing and the story development is well paced and interesting! The relationships between the characters feel very genuine and well built, it doesn't feel cheap at all. The story itself feels so immersive. It's genuinely one of the easiest thing to get into for me, it's been a while since I've been this hooked by a story. y'all the novel constantly established how kdj was considered ugly by everyone but if i hear one (1) comment about it in the webtoon i'm gonna be sitting there like "?????? bitch is you blind?????" #NoOneLovesYou No se ustedes pero quiero que ya salga en español 💯🔥🔥😎💖💘✌️😭 I’m gonna read this because I want to find out if there is an author to this novel. I wonder if the reader will come face to face with the author GUYS GUYS IF YOU'RE A WEBTOON/MANHWA READER I REALLY RECOMMEND READING THIS I finished reading the novel of this (yes it's completed!) a few weeks ago and IT'S SO GOOD I STILL CAN'T STOP THINKING ABOUT AAAAAAAAAAAAAA there is so much character development and plot is just *chef's kiss* MINDBLOWING

There's a reason why OMV is one of the most (if not THE most) popular webtoon in South Korea rn. God, I just love it so much!! This is actually good The art reminds me of Tower of God season 3 Any song recommendations you all listened to while reading the webtoon and novel? [ The constellation 'kimmeh kimmeh' encourages everyone to read this webtoon AND the novel ]

[ The constellation 'kimmeh kimmeh' says you will NOT regret it ]

When the webtoon and novel hit you that hard. 🤣💜 Is this Anime omg.... 20 plus chapters online don't buy it I'm korean flatform reader and i am sure that you must read this. This is hundred million down loaded in korea,,,, The legend of internet Nobel How did the webtoon grow up this fast ? Did the author self promoted himself or just it got popular on it's own ? Solo leveling creator? Anyway it's awsome since it has 551 chapters and im assuming that one episode of webtoon is one chapter...one chapter a week would take ten years to finish right ksajdhksj AHHHH YA QUIERO QUE APAREZCA URIEL 
Mi beBESITAAAA omg is this a movie teaser?! Hey web toon I request to make the mercules seris  lady bug and cat noir pleas made romantic sireas That line, "I'm just a reader", made me want to read it. 😍😍😍😍 Is this worth reading?? Just asking This webtoon is going to have a whole another level of paradoxes. I wish it get anime adaptation Check out the novel too, yo. It's got an epilogue. Broke my heart (somewhat). JONGHYUK ASHUDBOBHSS Banyakin dong komik kek gini Hope this get animated some day! This isn't going to be a power fantasy manhwa, its so good at how incredibly "balanced" everything is, there are going to be "feels" part in this but goddamn mannnn itss so fucking good, this manhwa is going to make subaru's suffering looks like a fucking joke How about SOLO LEVELING it was what all manga/manhwa/manhua readers waiting for come on guys This thing is worth reading!
Literally better than what I expected., I highly recommend reading Omniscient Reader ❤️❤️❤️Love this webtoon ❤️❤️❤️ I’m obsessed with this webtoon but I’m too broke to buy fast pass T-T X: who are you?
me: im juST A READER I am really liking this webtoon not gonna lie btw yall, there are 20 chapters on mangakakalot lol My baby has an adaptationnn. Congratulations!! 자랑스럽다 대한웹툰
자랑스럽다 전독시
자랑스럽다 싱숑 OMG, I love this novel.
No puedo creer que la vea ahora como webtoon, no entendere nada, pero ya se la historia, así que ya sabre que pasa. 😂 If this becomes an anime I will donate so much background song? This webtoon is like exactly what ive been waiting for. game like. level. op mc. apocalypse. streaming wtf ITS SO PERFECT GOD DAMN "I am just a reader" woof that hit hard 😱 Crunchyroll better make an anime about Omniscient Reader or I'm gonna riot >:( MAN IT WOULD BE DOPE IF THEY MAKE AN ANIME ABOUT THIS. I WOULD LOVE IT 💙💙💙💙 dokja really out here speedrunning the apocalypse At 1:02 you can see that, that. "A" is shining in the bottom....I wonder what that means? 😏😏😏😏 add  back  solo leveling what about buying the rights to solo leveling with the crunchy boys and make an adaptation instead? Ohhh no wonder the art style was so similar DOKJAAAAGGHHHH!!! I LOVE MY BOIII damn straight omg the trailer looks so good 
I’ve read up to chapter 50ish on the novel Soooo when solo leveling on webtoon I just wanted to escape from reality
YEAH ME Too I wanted to make my manga as webtoon  which I wanted to start; -; but I don't know  how to become featured artist... Lol you guys are slow the english scans is already out to chapter 19 3,149 episodes???!!!! Gotta find that webtoon! I have read the LN a while ago and Its a good fricken read 10/10 would recommend middle gets a little slow but its still a great read I can't wait for YJH to show up Sounds really stupid not gonna lie... imma go read it. Look I'd be more willing to read it with out the trailer if you just kept patt that same people who made solo made this I would of read it 100% ;-; From the studio that brought you Solo Leveling

Say no more im hooked Yurr Solo leveling must be next anime adaptation Not trying to spoil anything for anyone but Lee Gilyoung the smol child looks more scary than what I expected. Legit gave me chills Accept Jesus as the Son of God. According to the Bible, all Christians who recognize Jesus as the Son of God are able to be saved.

Read about Jesus’ death on the cross to understand salvation. In the Bible, God sends Jesus to Earth so that he can die and absolve humanity of original sin.

Devote yourself fully to God in everything you do. ...
If your confuse just do this if you want to be saved do this repent  know that you are a sinner , believe  that Christ  died for you for your sins  and That God raised him from the dead  on the third day . If you believe it  with all your heart all your soul and all your mind you will be saved by  The Holy's of Holy's.  Amen 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏 There's a reason why this is the most popular webnovel in South Korea. 
The MC is not an OP character but he's clever and way more charismatic. He's also a strategist using the knowledge he knows in the novel. He's not an emotionless robot or a killing machine. 
Side characters are not just there to be amazed by the MC, they're actually strong too on their own. They are lovable. 
There is no plot armor (you know what that means)....character deaths. 
The plot might be about survival and you think it's the same for many others. No it's not. You would be surprised. 
So stop comparing this to a power fantasy like Solo Levelling. As much as I love that manga because who hates an OP MC honestly? This far surpasses Solo Levelling because everyone has a mystery. Dislike epic I’m am so confused with this can someone explain THIS COMIC IS AMAIZNG There’s a lot more chapters on manga reader Solo Leveling got the webtoon game on smash Trust me this is really good This looks absolutely amazing even better than some anime trailers This has a webtoon!? I'm indefinitely reading it! So good never expected it too be bro someone turn my vampire system into a webtook READ IT Alright now I have to read the legendary mechanic,solo leveling,and now this? Good trailer for a change That moment you realize your a protagonist: 🔪👄🔪 I tried reading the webnovel and I dropped it. I guess it’s like solo leveling that had a slow start. I still can’t read solo leveling until  (spoiler)




after the mc gets the system. Anyway I think I should try giving the manhwa a try and then move onto the webnovel when it’s good. This WEBTOON is lit i just hope is uploads sooner Oh I started reading this not very long ago. It was good I just got a bit board with it a couple hundred chapters in. After reading god of high school, solo leveling, Unordinary, etc i have officially found a new found love and appreciation for WEBTOON and Korean manwha in general Plotwist : There's ANOTHER READER!!! read on mangakakalot for 16 chaptewrs this is msooooo good I love you U can read it free online don’t waste coins Who else is thinking of hentei This is done by the artist of solo leveling? It reminds me of SwordArtOnline This webtoon is based on web novel and the it's most popular web novel in korea. They should make this an anime just sayin Ima need more chapters ASAP Finna read this and solo leveing FROM SOLO LEVELING AUTHOR  HOLY CRAP YES I WILL READ THIS Wow. Thats actually really interesting. Definitely checkin this out. To the person that’s reading this:

You’re very intelligent and adorable human!
Stay healthy in quarantine

My dream is to have 1k. I been struggling to get there!!!🙏 God dammit I was gonna sleep, sitting here hyping me up like this, oh well, we all know sleep isn’t for the weak, “it’s for the meager” Ni I hope there's an anime for omnicient reader, sweet home and hardcore leveling warrior. Man.. I just love these series so much. 🥺 Stumbled across this one completely by accident when it just came out a few months ago. LOVE IT!!! Good job line webtoon you hit a big one. LINEマンガで連載してるけどこれも、webtoonだったんか If the “three ways to survive the apocalypse “ was an actual story then this came out, that would’ve been amazing too lol There’s more chapters on a another webs btw I wished this happened to me but instead I get reincarnated as another person and live a fantasy world like in a anime novel or show Read the novel. Loved it. literal chills (´；ω；｀) yes yes yes yesyesyesyes!! A high quality novel is desrving of a high quality webtoon which I am eternally thankful for TT.TT This plot is like a mirror on a mirror creating an infinity sequence of mirrors if this gets an anime broooo please make it an anime This webtoon is new but already shining I'm gonna stay with it though all episodes till the end and then cry my eyes out for another great webtoon ending I underestimated this webtoon but it is a must read. Waw 😌💅 I wonder if this gets an anime adaptation This is like the pure result to any weeb who wants attack on titan to happen irl

(They want to be with levi ackerman) 이제 영어로 3회차를 시작하겠다 I’ve already started reading it I’m a chapter 19 Uriel best girl So they have time to make a new one but not add to solo leveling Someone, please make this an anime Webtoon only has up to chapter 9 so far though, and only up to chapter 4 for free... You know that on other websites, this webtoon has like 10 more chapters than on the actual app dang webtoon is really stepping up the game with these new trailers Read the novel they said....it’ll be fun they said...













No joke it’s actually pretty good. I’m only 200 chapters in but damn it’s a novel that I truly enjoy. Who else here from the ad This is at 19 chapters online for free don’t waste ur time in WEBTOON waiting It's like The Neverending Story but better. I knew it they had something similar Lookie lookie there is now three jin-woos Σ('◉⌓◉’) that looks so cool omg Brought to you by creators of solo leveling Ye it’s so tuff I slept on it for a bit cuz I was mad they stop workin on solo leveling Hehe fools who use WEBTOON fear my power of illegal online reading in which there is already 18 chapters not the puny 4 Only a matter of time until we start getting literal animated webtoons. Webtoon.gif hype gonna be strong YESSS THE WEBTOON IS HERE IM GETTING HYPED KYYAAA Why is there only 3 chapters when there's actually 19 or more I hope the mc doesn’t get powers. Like his only ability is that he knows what’s going to happen or maybe he also has some other power, but it doesn’t boost any of his base attributes (or stats if you’re a gamer). Reading a book must've never felt so exciting huh I don’t dont know how they do it but the promotional video always makes the webtoon seem worse then it is. I was actually avoiding this webcom but now...think ima check it ouuuut This new premise has become a rising gem! It reminds me of “My New Life As A Villainess!” and “Scum-Villain’s Self-Saving System” in the awareness of our main character, but it presents this main character as starting as a reader and taking up the role of hero immediately without being placed in the mind of an antagonist! I’m greatly considering it! That was the worst trailer in the world This looks sooooo goood I gotta read this Yea it’s rlly good so far I. Am. Completely compelled to read this. He look like Sun Jin Woo.. You should read I am just reading it it is a must It would hilarious if he just failed, and that’s that. is this solo player prequel If this were made into an anime and made right this could be one of the best animes and this is coming from someone wgo hasnt read it yet and just from the trailer it looks le epik Saw the add. Saw solo leveling in the same title. Clicked. DLAKHSDF THATS LOOKS SO COOL WHAT HOW THE HELL HAVE I NEVER HEARD OF THIS??? 0:37 wait what’s daichi doing here I finished the novel literally 2 days ago. I didn’t know they where making a manga!!!! Can’t wait for this as it was one of my favorites. I really want this to be animated ughhh The novel of this was so fucking good Oh I have read that one. It’s really good 👍👍 The drawing looks almost if not the same as solo leveling If you like good character development, relationships and plot I HIGHLY recommend reading this and the original novel, bc so far its following the novel really well(which is the first web novel I’ve read bc it’s so good) The novel is so good you guys are in for a ride I am so happy this went to webtoon so it may be ANIMATED OR EVEN BE ON A GAME AAAAAHHHH

I love this light novel so much uwu This manhwa has like 20 episodes out..
But on webtoon it's only 10🤦 YESSSS ITS OUT FINALLYYY AAAAAA The protagonist looks like jin woo from solo leveling I’ve read this before webtoon had it ;-; Manganelo readers where you at I just read it on webtoon recommendation sneak peek and Omg thank you!!
This story is just crazy!!! Only if solo leveling was on WEBTOON, they would be able to adapt an anime 😔 Basically fanfiction.
(Not an insult) How solo leveling isn’t on webtoon then? Honestly, I didn’t like the main character so I’m dropping it, otherwise I would have read 73rd Demon King, and also one hell of a friend I never thought I would read a Y/N fan fic or comic before and now I'm reading a guy reading Y/N It's good Y'all should check out a Webtoon called Ordeal. The art is on another level! Dude I really hope this gets a anime because it’s sooooo good!! Sadly it’s only on chapter 4 on web toon but chapter 19 everywhere else This trailer made every hair on my body stand up.
Excuse me while I go read every last episode of this comic Wait wait....are you saying that my favourite webtoon is actually coming  to official Webtoon?!!! Holy crab, this is an actual blessing!! Oh my God ( in JoJo's voice) Haven’t read much but the artwork is amazing Started reading this Today and it's Fire
THE ART ALONE I fucking LOVE this novel I feel like were actually Dokja cuz.... c'mon I was reading it...I thought it was a Manhwa... Yeah, I can tell the story is way better than Solo Leveling ;). Currently reading the light novel if it keeps up this is gonna be one of the best webtoons!
Get ready guys you in one hell of a ride!!! :D Ohhhhhh,thaaats super coool! 80!!! I f*cking knew it was the same something creator whatever. So basically a prologue or an alternate universe of only I level up Whenever i meet a weeb outside or on internet i make sure to recommend this gem. Like *You gotta read this shit Right Now!* its like ripoff version of solo levelling. When you read it for the free coins but you actually get hooked to the story That ending gave me chills! WHAT THE HELL THE TRAILER IS SO BEAUTIFUL AAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH

after reading ORV in webnovel and webtoon medium, *_now I want to watch this as a high quality anime_* /sobs/ Dokja.... 😢😢😢😢 this was actually a manhwa before it was even on webtoon.... you can read it on a website called webtoon.xyz

also it is up to like chapter 17? This is gonna be a great webtoon. The light novel is a masterpiece in my opinion can’t wait to see it webtoonized The manga not being finished made me read the novel.  





But Now I don’t know who is who when someone is talking and I get confused.
;~;





This is why I’m better off with reading the manga. 







BUT ITS NOT FINISHED.    ;~;~; It is quite good DAMN I JUST NOTICED IF THIS WAS ANIMATED IT WOULD LOOK SO GOOD- This is a great read I do recommend you read it if you haven’t Came Can out during sunmmer I’m still on webtoon because of inordinary remember when it first came out so long ago I would go against reading it to anyone, it's confusing if you don't know Korean history and the ending is very disappointing. Seems interesting , I might look into it! Literally read this 3 days ago. This is no longer animated images, by God this is an anime trailer !! Yo when are we gonna get " Everyone else is a returnee" I read some of the episodes already and they’re amazing I bet he wrote it for himself from the future I wish anime's existence was just fiction Why did I get logged out my account :( The novel is really good too Dad: reading is power

Me: so you read it to? Guys its not a webtoon original comic thats why its actually good Y’all remember when this was on reaperscans lol can’t wait to read When you already read the novel and your exited for the web toon >:3 Alright, give me all the spoilers NOW Words cannot explain my excitement for this right now. With webtoon getting anime’s this will be a great one for sure I’m already hooked It was an interesting novel. I didn’t like it but you might. Bettt Man. I read the novel a way back since it came out and I was mind blown by how good it was.  NOW we get the comic version. The comic does justice to the novel although some parts are missing because the novel itself has a lot of exposition but they make it up with the art. LIKE THE BACKGROUND IS REALLY IMPORTANT. Like the background of the art comes back as really important stuff. Definitely a new experience just like it was meant to be. I am happy for the comic version. This looks pretty cool Yeet I’ve been injecting this straight into my veins for the past month and a half omg is anyone else excited to ship dokja and jonghyuk🥺. their relationship is probably the most developed out of all of them in the novel and it's so cute🥰

(also pls don't hate on this comment😢) This is a very promising webtoon YO THE ANIMATION IS OP I just noticed the MC looks like Jin Woo from Solo Leveling So why is solo leveling not on WEBTOON? Definitely recommend ehhh? This is a WEBTOON? I read it at Zeroscans, better check it out  on the webtoon app might have more chapts (nvm it’s at chapter 5, zeroscans is at like 18, they haven’t uploaded any new chapters so maybe WEBTOON bought the series from them) I thought this was from the Solo Leveling people. It had that art style. So far it’s pretty good Webtoon really is trying to push the ysa fl agenda lol. But ljh looks so cool in that classroom shot!! Oh man it's officially out!! Anyways so everyone join the omniscient reader english fandom discord because the webnovel was great and the webtoon looks just as great so far and they've opened up a discussion area for webtoon only readers so you can talk about what happens as the chapters get released Rip reaperscans they have my respect and I hope webtoon doesn’t make the redraws shit pls don’t do this to us again I THOUGHT THE THUMBNAIL WAS DEKU AND IIDA FROM MHA- but holy damn this looks sick Time to see the greatest bromance in history in art form HYPE HYPE HYPE I just picked up the novel and mwah the flavor.... I already started this on a different site but what the hell are those last chapter never seen that before I started reading this comic because of the free coin event and I swear am not regretting 😍🔥 This webtoon is ❤︎ beautiful ❤︎ solo leveling is such a good webtoon so this should be great as well Anyone not gonna mention that same artist also drew solo leveling?? (Its very obvious thought) This is actually a pretty well written story so far. You can't really predict what is going to happen next. The MC is not exactly the MC of this story, which will make you think what the hell is going on here and trust me when i say this, they actually make this dynamic work. Excited to see how this story goes. When I saw solo leveling I screamed and now it is my duty to read this before I died I never thought I’d see the day webtoon puts a system-esque manhwa on its platform. I assumed it’d never happen... but then again, with Solo Levelling, they’d probably  want to get in on it. Hopefully they’ll put more web novel adapted manhwas on their platform, it’d be nice if they were a bit more mainstream Love the art style since its from the same studio that made Solo Leveling YALL THIS IS THE BEST FUCKING NOVEL I EVER READ. Please give it a read before checking out the web toon, it’s on Webnovel. Why i'm crying watching this? ;-; YAZZZZ FINALLY *Constellation  "Demon King of Salvation" is smiling from above* Good shit! Read the novel too! What in the name of off brand sung Jin woo is this WHERE ARE THE ANIMATORS?😭 If you haven't read this yet, I recommend it 100%. The story is absolutely mind-blowing, and I say with complete seriousness that this will probably become one of my favorite webtoons. On another note, I do recommend reading the novel for that extra experience, but I'm really curious to see how this story will turn out as a webtoon.

I can't wait! I'm so glad this got an adaption, wwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww GET READY TO CRY PEOPLE This gave me solo leveling vibes Wait...did i just see bam... This is such an amazing webtoon. the art is GORGEOUS!!!!!!!!!!!! I was just about to read the novel. Until this came up. And my mind went 'MUST READ'. This is so exciting! Damn I got goosebumps because the background music was intense 😳 It is a must read ✨ Just a heads up!
For those of you interested in reading the novel, please give it a try as well! It's really good, and it was one of the first novels that got me into light novels in the first place! The novel was just recently completed too, so you can go ahead and binge read it as well. There is A LOT of world and character building, and watching Yoo Jonghyuk's and Dokja's relationship development (as well as character, though I'd prefer not to spoil it) is going to be a nice treat! For those of you interested in isekai genres, don't mind an OP protagonist, or prefer a protagonist that's down to earth, I highly recommend this, Trash of the Count's Family (an on-going fantasy novel with lots of world building and character dynamics) and the S-classes I raised (which has a similar yet different concept compared to ORV, with a protagonist that's trying to save his little brother). These are the novels I started with, and it's also what got me into light novels in the first place! Please have a look at them! I literally cried for an hour or so from happiness when I heard there would be a manghwa about Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint. (っ˘̩╭╮˘̩)っ I HIGHLY RATE THIS MANHWA, I have been a huge fan of the light novel and have read the whole thing, AND with the solo leveling art, it will be amazing WEBTOON TURN THIS INTO AN ANIME YOU WON'T REGRET THE DECISION AND HIRE DESCENT VOICE ACTORS.

Edit:
Also, webtoon should really add "Solo Leveling"  to their web series collection. cool The artwork is absolutely amazing and this webtoon is my favourite. You can't change my mind YYYYYAAAAAAAAAAAASSSSSSSSSS FINALLY IT GOT THE RECOGNITION IT DESERVED This webtoon is soooo good 💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜 This is going to be my Replacement for Sweet Home OH MY GOSH TURN THIS INTO AN ANIME The like button turn my hand into a crisp he said electrocute me and you said to try it so I did wow damnn ive read this one from other sites and lemme just say this series never disappoints! it's insanely good! a must read can this be an anime alr 😭😭 What the hell. Webtoon is such a addictive app😵😵 My first story I am reading is freaking romance And i just read 60 episodes in a day😣😢 without any break. As it comes only on sunday so I want something to pass my time. So I started reading true beauty and again i read 100 episodes in a day😅. I am just confused how it can be that much of my type. I am just 11 and It has improved my english very much.
Hope I have written right english. 
😅😅 This series looks epic🔥🔥🔥🔥😱🙌 If the webtoon site didn't keep loading blank screens I would totally read this. Dam ive been reading this but i didnt know it was gonna be on webtoons That ending tho!! I wanted more seasons of it. HELL YEAH i love the novel so much..... i don’t normally read webnovels but orv is the only valid isekai.... so good!! Friendly reminder, there are 18 chapters out rn, webtoon has only released 4 Imma read it ISNT THIS A NOVEL TOO??? Imma go read it ASAP Crunchyroll: time to adapt more manhwas Les falló el audio mis panas pero que belleza de webtoon está destinado a tener el primer lugar al menos unos años Español please I've read ahead in the manhwa and I must say this is a must read! be careful of spoilers everyone! Cooooollll~~` if you guys want to read a bit more, there are 19 eps in mangao.com but youll have to wait like two months to get there on webtoon ;-; I can finally enjoy life because of, *p  a  i  d t o b e h o m e .c o m* i just like how he say ''Im just a reader'' im like damm son Why I read in webtoon? simply because that guys are soo hot que HAY DIOS MIO!! Okay i am convinced.  Let's give it a try Wow, this looks awesome- YESSS IVE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS I am reading this and is gteat I got a notification of webtoon abt this and then I got a youtube notification so now I am here :) I bet most of you clicked this thinking it was SAO I will be frank with u guys....this webtoon is greater than solo levelling, tomb raider king, SAO, Log horizon, hello world, dungeon seeker, tales of demons and gods, The live, etc. According to me its the best story i have ever read so far. Legit. 😮 So far the best Webtoon trailer I’ve seen I was waiting for this trailer since i started it!!!!! Fact: the same who drew Solo Leveling is now drawing this webtoon. I love it! I just came back from reading solo leveling and saw this as a recommendation. This is good and all but When is solo leveling coming to WEBTOON 😭😭 Bon aller jle call ça va être un des meilleurs webtoon This is so good Can't express how happy I was when I first heard that Line Webtoon got the localization of Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint and not a similar website that have some paywall or some shizz 👀 More ppl get to read ORV for free! I hope they also license Trash Of The Count's Family ughhhhhhh the thoughts of my two faves getting the recognition?? Feels good 💕 Better than most trailers 😂👌 DAMNNNN BEST TRAILER IVE EVER SEEN!!!! a Brooo, this would be an amazing anime I’m feeling a solo leveling vibe from this Webtoon just hyped this up SO FRICKING MUCH!! Imagine how meta it would be if this was the webtoon in the webtoon Al pareacer soy la única que habla español (esta fenomenal el trailer , va a pasar "años "para que llegue traducido (︶︹︺).
Pero me alegra que existan historias tan buenas ＼(^o^)／. I thought the art style was familiar Jokes on you! Im a huge Solo Leveling Fan, so I read this one already >:D I thought this would be shitty but I read some of it and it’s pretty decent. This looks so much like Solo Leveling, must read❤ Cool! Here comes the normies... Okay am gonna read this I JUST finished reading the first few episodes I've followed the novel. This was perhaps one of the greatest novels I've read. Of course, the protagonist is a cheat in his own way but the world still would kick him down any time he pushes past his boundaries. There were tons of character developments. The worldbuilding was phenomenal. There's really nothing much you can ask of it. Maybe if it had been longer, I guess? Have fun with the webtoon version, read it to the end, you won't regret it. I can't be the only one who thinks this is almost as good as those Marvel trailers XD The problem is this WEBTOON has 18 translated chapters already but on WEBTOON it has 9 with fast pass no one would pay for old chapters just release all the available chapters then people would read it on your website or it would be the same as dice OMG i still cant believe its on webtoon now YESSS When will they make a trailer for 
Antistalker
Phase
Mom I'm sorry 
Back to you
Killmax Read it. Its Amazing. Didnt think much of it but wow.... Worth the read 😁😁😁😁 Rip intik anime will came out 4th time rewatching this trailer, still gives me goosebumps The question is: is he saucier than saucy woo? I'm reading the novel and webtoon and it's super good. This has a lot of potential Is this isekai like the princesses webtoon which they go into kingdom world after reading webnovel?????? Gosh... I'm in shock. Gotta read this asap!!! Is this gonna come to Hero Cantare next update?

The novel of this is pretty AMAZINGGG.And completed!

I have waited so long for this trailer!!! can l ask something?,is it important that if l"m making my own webtoon then l need to draw the panels and pages like in real webtoon? can't l draw it like a manga page or comic page? Author: So how many times are you gonna be a tsundere to Kim Dokja?

Yoo Jonghyuk: Yes *me watches this webtoons trailor*

So I'm recommend to read this webtoon cuz the art give the same vibe More binge able content Ooooh I seriously need this to be an anime after reading the first few chapters Seems pretty good actually Bro this seems like the coolest idea ever wth The author should have ended the novel at 3000+ episodes, just to be more immersive Bro this shit is straight fire a most read I started reafing this webtoon as soon as it came oit nd the storyline nd art style is so impressive. 🤩 Every readers dream!! 😍😍😍 AAAAAAA FINALLY A TRAILER HIGHLY RECOMMENDED It JUST came out and it already has a trailer.

아아 해외 꺼도 좀 잘생각해서 가져와주십쇼
한국 꺼만 가져가지말고 Hello, want to do yourself a favour? 
Read it. This webtoon is exciting. There are  only a few episodes on youtube yet it keeps me on looking forward to another episode This story is good and quite interesting so far definitely worth checking out, there are 4 chapters available in English atm, the 5th chapter will be out tomorrow on Wednesday, it also reminds me abit of Solo Leveling I have a new husbano started reading the translated novel and it's incredible. so excited for what's to come I thought it looked interesting but I never read it, and then it said that I could get free cons for it and I realized that I really missed out By far one of the best Webtoon trailers! Keep it up! is this solo leveling? Kinda reminds me of solo-leviling I've been waiting for this wow finally webtoon made a good trailer👏🏽👏🏽 I saw a YouTube video about this and I try to find it but could not find it   and 3 or 2 days later I see this

Animé I read this webtoon😄 the exact same art style / aesthetic as solo leveling, oh yes Yess Holy Moly Now I really need the anime 😩💙 I swear, this webtoon  Sweet Home, and all the apocalyptic themed webtoons will be the only reason I will survive a apocalypse 😅😅 These drawings look very similar to solo leveling Gosshh i became addicted to this comic~ 🤧🤧❤❤❤ Hehe what a journey this will be I've heard of "Reading is Life", but this takes it to a whole other level! wow i'm gonna read this on webtoon now lol #EarlySquad I really like the art style it reminds me of solo leveling a little tho This trailer's so good omg- it's like im in a cinema Mwhahahahah I knew about this way before Webtoon got it and I've read it! At least so far what been released but awesome trailer y'all are gonna love it!! Tip:
dont read the comments to the webtoon, they most likely will have spoilers, as this was adapted from a Korean Novel!
(Or read them and get spoiled-) Lois like it’s done by the same artists that did Solo Leveling/ also this is a fun read so far would recommend if you are looking for something dark/survival-esk Ok but, why do he look so much like Sung Jin-Woo from Solo Leveling (btw it’s amazing, go read it if u haven’t). Yaass, finally here ajfwundjso This already looks like it can be an anime already, another amazing series to be animated. LETS GOOOO!! I can’t wait to read this! I was actually reading the latest episode when the notification popped up i— 👁️👄👁️ Ngl when I first saw that monster in one of the eps I thought he was a bit cute but when it got angry I was like-
